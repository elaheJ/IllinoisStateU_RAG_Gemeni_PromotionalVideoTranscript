ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

The Master of Science in Nursing is distributed among core, support, and nursing specialty courses. 34-44 semester hour program (depending on sequence chosen).
All students must successfully complete a synthesis project within the specified capstone course from each sequence. NUR 477 is the capstone course identified for the Family Nurse Practitioner sequence, NUR 483 is the capstone course identified for the Leadership and Management (NLM) sequence. Those students interested in research and doctoral study may choose to complete a thesis that would result in additional degree hours.
The master’s program is developed based on nationally recognized standards for graduate education in nursing. All courses applied toward the degree must be completed at the 400 level or above. In order to maintain clinical proficiency, students who have completed the final practicum course for their enrolled sequence but who do not meet the requirements for graduation must enroll in ongoing practicum independent study (NUR 400) until graduation. A contract outlining the specific requirements for the Independent Study will be developed between the Director of Graduate Programs and the student.

The MBA degree assumes an undergraduate knowledge base in business and economics which students with undergraduate degrees in business will normally have acquired.
Students admitted with nonbusiness undergraduate degrees may have to complete Pre-MBA Program courses before enrolling in the MBA core courses. Specific requirements will be determined by the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Curriculum (hereafter referred to as "Associate Dean"). The responsibility for demonstrating prior academic coverage of the material at the appropriate level rests with the student and should be completed at least one month prior to the beginning of the first semester of course work. Students who have not taken college algebra, economics, accounting, finance, and/or statistics within the past five years are strongly encouraged to take the Pre-MBA Program courses as a refresher prior to their first core course.
Students with a non-business undergraduate degree should expect to complete some or all of the following Pre-MBA Program courses online. 
Fundamentals of Economics 
Financial Accounting
Managerial Accounting 
Principles of Management 
Principles of Marketing 
Business Math and Statistics 
Understanding Corporate Finance 
Business Law Essentials
In addition to any Pre-MBA Program courses required, some or all of which may be waived based on an individual's previous academic work, all MBA candidates must complete one of the following sequences:
Traditional MBA Sequence
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416 
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450; Students who have successfully completed 12 or more undergraduate semester hours in a required core area may be eligible to substitute a 400-level elective in that area for the required core course. 
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485 
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. (Graduate courses at the 300-level may not be taken to fulfill the MBA elective requirements). In consultation with a Master of Business Administration advisor, students can choose from among a wide offering of elective courses to design a Plan of Study. The choice should be congruent with each student's goals. Elective courses are offered based on student demand. Elective courses taken outside the College of Business require prior approval by the Associate Dean and often involve additional course work to fulfill prerequisites.
Corporate MBA Sequence (CMBA)
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. The CMBA is a cohort program. Students vote to choose which three electives the cohort will take.
Panama MBA Sequence
42 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416
18 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450, BIS 468;

Required Credit Hours: 36
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450 
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485

Course Limitations
No more than a total of three (3) credits can be counted from any 400 (Independent Study) and 498 (Internship) courses. Exceptions must be approved by the Associate Dean. Credit will not be given for course numbers below 400 (no 300-level graduate course will be counted in a Traditional or Corporate MBA Plan of Study). All core and elective courses must be completed within six years from the time of taking the first core course.
Credit-Hour Limitations for Non-Business Graduate Students
While other graduate programs on campus may require and/or give elective credit for selected MBA courses, non-MBA graduate students will not be permitted to exceed 12 credit hours of MBA course work. Non-business students seeking to enroll in MBA courses will first need to obtain their major advisor’s permission to register for classes and then must submit to the MBA Office an online override request form. Permission to enroll is dependent upon space availability in the requested course(s) and prior completion of prerequisites. MBA students will have priority in registration.
Courses
Descriptions of courses leading to the MBA degree are found under the Departments of Finance, Insurance and Law; Management; Marketing; Accounting; and Master of Business Administration.
Repetition of Courses in the MBA Program
A student may register officially for an MBA course (core or elective) only twice. A student who completes a course or drops a course after census day (the tenth day of the semester) may officially enroll in the same course only one additional time.

Advanced Standing Credit for Students Enrolling in a Doctoral Professional Practice Program
Advanced Standing Credit for Students Enrolling in a Doctoral Professional Practice Program
Approved 10/29/19 
A limit of 24 hours of advanced standing credit may be granted to a doctoral student with a previous master’s degree in a related field of study. The graduate program coordinator will determine whether the 24 hours should be granted when the student applies for admission to the program. Technically, this is not transfer credit and does apply to any of the limits listed below.
Doctoral candidates who have previously earned a master’s degree or its equivalent approved by one of the regional accreditation associations or by the agencies recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation may be granted 24 semester hours of advanced standing credit toward the doctoral degree if approved by the program and the Graduate School at the time of admission. The 24 hours are subtracted from the total hours required for the doctorate from the baccalaureate, if applicable. The 24 hours are not counted toward the maximum allowed transfer credit limit or computed in the cumulative graduate GPA. A copy of the transcript showing the earned degree is required. Degree equivalency from foreign institutions is determined by International Admissions. Advanced standing credit will only be granted for courses completed within five years of admission to the doctoral professional practice program and a grade of B or higher must have been achieved.

The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
Scheduling and Using Facilities for Campus Recreation
Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve space in the Student Fitness Center, McCormick Hall, Gregory Street Fields, or the Redbird Adventure Center, please fill out a Facility Request Form.
For any questions regarding scheduling or facility use in these spaces, please call 309-438-8426.
Costs Incurred
The University establishes fee rates for use of University facilities and spaces based on the relationship between the University and the person or organization using the facility. Rental rates may vary depending on whether the individual or organization is considered a RSO, a University organization, an Alumni organization, the public, or a nonprofit charitable organization.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
Administration and Procedural Application
Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Coordinator of Events will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security, staff, insurance requirements, and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, including but not limited to:
Anticipated attendance, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, and entry fee or registration charge.
Noise that could be generated from the event and the impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity.
Impact on traffic and parking.
Adequacy and suitability requested to the location.
Event history, time of the activity, performer history, first time event.
Set-up or clean-up needs, and equipment requested.
Compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies.
Potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others.
Presence of minor, food or beverages, animals, media, or technology needs.
Any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section.
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-serve basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Coordinator of Events will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the Vice President for Student Affairs or designee.
Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
Campus Recreation will review the event details, assess the event, and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. Campus Recreation must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed.
If certain risks are associated with the proposed event, the following offices may make recommendations to Campus Recreation:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events.
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Emergency Management Plan if necessary.
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Campus Recreation recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
Staffing levels may be adjusted, as necessary, based on changing conditions/needs. The final decision on permitting an event at Campus Recreation facilities and spaces will be made after consideration of any recommendations from the offices above.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, set-up costs, staffing charges, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
Food on Campus
Food, beverage, and/or catering is not permitted within Campus Recreation facilities unless pre-authorized to do so in writing. A Food Permit may be required as stated in the University Policy on Sale/Distribution of Food on Campus.
Verification of food permit will be submitted to Campus Recreation by the client at least 7 business days prior to the event. If not received, no food will be permitted.
Events Involving Minors
If the proposed event or activity will involve minors, the sponsor or group must complete the University Program/Activities Involving Minors registration and comply with the University Protection of Minors Policy.
The registration form will be reviewed and must be approved by the Minors Activity Committee in advance of the event. This confirmation should be sent to the Coordinator of Events and Outreach within Campus Recreation.
Solicitation and Sales
Promotion or sales of merchandise is prohibited in Campus Recreation facilities. An exception may be made for events at Gregory Street Fields with written pre-authorization from Campus Recreation. Requests for an exemption at Gregory Street Fields should be made no less than seven (7) business days prior to the event or activity.
Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall “hosting” of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building.
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University’s institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its programs without written authorization.
Violations or Non-Compliance Behavior
Violation of this policy could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including but not limited to the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods. Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSO’s) will be handled through the Student Code of Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office. Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources. Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

Degree Offered: B.A., B.S.
Major in Legal Studies
The Legal Studies curriculum is an American Bar Association approved paralegal educational program. It is designed to prepare students for a career as a paralegal in public and private law offices, corporate law departments, and government agencies. Students learn how to communicate effectively with both lawyers and laymen. When acting under an attorney’s supervision, a trained paralegal can perform many law-related tasks although they do not give legal advice to clients, set fees or represent clients in court. Paralegals may not provide legal services directly to the public except as permitted by law.
Admission to the Legal Studies major is limited and based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: courses completed, cumulative GPA, hours completed, personal interview or written statement, and samples of work completed. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission, and the application process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
 In order to gain admission into the Legal Studies minor, a student must have completed at least two (2) Legal Studies courses (one of which must be LGS 201); and must have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 2.50 in those two Legal Studies courses. For further information contact the Department of Politics and Government.

Facility and Space Use
Athletic Facilities
Athletic Facilities
Athletic facilities include Redbird Arena, Horton Fieldhouse, Horton Pool, athletic fields, and tennis courts.
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by Athletics. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as “facilities and grounds”). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn.
The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.
Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus. Athletic facilities not generally accessible for use by the public are not available for unscheduled expressive activities.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. an athletic facility or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time. 
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
Scheduling and Using Facilities for Athletics
To schedule or reserve space in Redbird Arena, Horton Fieldhouse, Hancock Stadium, Hancock Stadium Club, contact the Athletics Department, Redbird Arena, Room 223, (309) 438-2000, athleticfacilities@illinoisstate.edu. Other Athletic facilities may be scheduled for restricted use. 
Cost Incurred  
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, an Athletic Department official may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, an Athletic Department official may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, an Athletic Department official may ask that the event cease and desist.
Administration and Procedural Application
Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Athletic Department representative will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
impact on athletic scheduled events
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Athletic Department representative will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the Director of Athletics or designee.
Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The Athletic Department representative will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary.  
If certain risks are associated with the proposed event, the following offices may make recommendations to the Athletics Department as necessary.
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Emergency Management Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Athletics recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
Athletics may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs. A final decision will be made after consideration of all recommendations.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
Events Involving Minors
If the proposed event or activity will involve minors, the sponsor or group must complete the University Program/Activities Involving Minors registration and comply with the University Protection of Minors Policy.
This form will be reviewed and must be approved by the Minors Activity Committee in advance of the event. This confirmation should be sent to Hayden Young at 309-438-3630, email at hyoung@illinoisstate.edu, or contact Emily Schierenbeck at 309-438-8353, email at AT_easchi1@illinoisstate.edu.
Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associated with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall “hosting” of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building.  
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.
Violations or Non-Compliance Behaviors
Violation of this procedure could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including but not limited to the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods. Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) will be handled through the Code of Student Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office. Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources. Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The Minor in African-American Studies provides an interdisciplinary approach to the examination of black politics and life in the United States. This program is designed to be of interest to students who want to explore the many contributions African-Americans have made to the political, historical, social, and artistic fabric of the United States. Students are required to take a core of two courses on African-American history and literature, as well as elective courses in the social sciences (History, Sociology, and Politics and Government) and in the humanities and fine arts (English, Music, and Theatre and Dance), and in interdisciplinary programs (including relevant course offerings in Interdisciplinary Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies).

 Minor in Children's Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The Minor in Children's Studies provides an opportunity for students to enhance their knowledge of children and child culture through interdisciplinary exploration of child-related issues. This program is designed to be of interest to students who wish to pursue child-related emphases in their major disciplines, such as education, children's literature, child psychology, children's history and culture, pediatrics, juvenile justice, or social work with children, or for those who wish to learn more about the subject of childhood from multidisciplinary frames of reference.

 Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Center for Civic Engagement

This interdisciplinary minor prepares students to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in their communities. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world. The minor gives students opportunities to sharpen their analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action. The minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden their learning experience and career perspectives.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies.

Minor in Peace and Conflict Resolutions Studies 
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The Minor in Peace and Conflict Resolution Studies is an interdisciplinary program that includes courses from eighteen departments. The Minor provides a comprehensive and in-depth approach to peace and conflict resolution theories and methods. Students are required to take an introductory course, as well as one course from each of four areas of inquiry (social justice, violence prevention and conflict resolution, environmental justice, and globalization), while also specializing in one of these areas with two additional courses. The minor's capstone experience is a professional practice.
The Minor allows students to examine the causes and prevention of war, as well as the nature of violence, including social oppression, discrimination and marginalization. They also learn peace strategies to overcome persecution and transform society to attain a more just and equitable international community. The inquiry encompasses micro to macro perspectives. At the micro end of the spectrum, students investigate non-violent ethics and conflict management; interpersonal communication and relations; intergroup relations; and diversity and gender issues. At the macro level, students explore the dynamics of international conflict, as well as approaches to peace and world order; ethnic and socioeconomic justice; multiculturism; renewable economics; and biodiversity.
Students are encouraged to consult with the program director and/or advisor regarding course selection.

Program Admission Requirements for New and Continuing Students: Admission to this academic program is limited and is based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: courses completed, cumulative GPA, hours completed, personal interview or written statement, and samples of work completed. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
Credentialing Opportunities
There is no single professional credential or certification that is necessary to pursue a career in Exercise Science. However, there are a number of optional credentialing opportunities that students are encouraged to examine. Coursework in this major is focused on the content areas needed for certification preparation by several organizations in this professional field of study. Students graduating in this major can strengthen their professional credentials by pursuing a variety of different certifications offered by organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Strength and Conditioning Association. Students interested in learning more about these recommended certification options should consult the Exercise Science Program Director in the School of Kinesiology and Recreation for further information.
Standards for Progress in the Major
Once admitted to either sequence within the Exercise Science major, the student must maintain a minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA. A student falling below the required 2.50 GPA will be placed on probation for one semester. If after one semester the 2.50 GPA has not been re-established, the student will be dropped from the Exercise Science major. A student who has been thus dropped from the Exercise Science major may reapply for admission to the major after raising his or her GPA to the required standard. The student who is not readmitted after one semester of probation and has a minimum 2.00 GPA will have the option of entering the Kinesiology Studies Sequence.
Students in the Exercise Science major must complete one of the following sequences.
Allied Health Professions Sequence
Exercise Science is the study of movement and the associated functional responses and adaptations the body makes as a result of movement/exercise. The Allied Health Professions sequence provides students with a well-rounded foundation in areas of exercise science, including functional anatomy, exercise physiology, biomechanics, sports and exercise psychology, and motor behavior. In addition, the Allied Health Professions sequence requires advanced science course work to prepare students for graduate studies in athletic training, physical therapy, physician's assistant, and other allied health programs.

Major in Sociology
Sociology majors at Illinois State explore a diverse range of topics and learn to think critically about the social world. Our distinguished faculty members are committed to helping students develop the analytical skills they need to gain a deeper understanding of the world in which we live.
Sociologists look under the surface of social life. They analyze data and develop theories in order to understand and explain social patterns, issues, and problems. Sociology not only helps us understand the roots of these issues and problems, but can also help inform policies that contribute to their solutions.
View Sociology Course Requirements

Anthropology
Degree Offered: B.A., B.S.
Major in Anthropology
Anthropology is a discipline concerned with people in their entirety: our evolution and physical variation, the remnants of our prehistoric past, the cultural and linguistic diversity of human societies past and present.
Anthropology has four subfields: archaeology, anthropological linguistics, cultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. An anthropological education begins with learning the fundamentals. This means taking courses representative of all four subfields.
Students in the Anthropology major must complete one of the following sequences.
Anthropology Sequence

Accelerated Anthropology Sequence
View Accelerated Anthropology Course Requirements
Program Admission Requirements
The Accelerated Anthropology Sequence (AAS) is a pathway to the Master’s Program in Anthropology. Accelerated degree programs offer high-achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor’s degree and master’s degree with one additional year of study. Students accepted to the sequence will be allowed to take courses during their senior year that will count toward both the undergraduate and graduate programs in anthropology. Qualifying students must apply to the AAS in the spring semester of their junior year. Admission is based on space availability and competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures and deadlines are available on the Anthropology Program website.
Acceptance into the AAS constitutes acceptance into the Master’s Program in Anthropology and thus students will take up to 12 hours of graduate-level credits during their senior year. To transfer to graduate-only status for their second year, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the Master’s Program in Anthropology in the spring of their senior year. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing and have made good progress towards their M.A. degree during their senior year.
A maximum of 12 of the total 15 hours of elective courses may be taken for graduate credit
Some 300-level courses are offered for undergraduate or graduate credit. Students in the Accelerated Sequence who want to count a 300-level course toward their 12 hours of required graduate coursework, must enroll in the 300-level course for graduate credit at the beginning of the course in order for it to count.
To graduate in this sequence, a student must take at least one course for graduate credit during the senior year. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure approval.
Notes
The following anthropology courses may be taken by anthropology majors to fulfill General Education requirements but do not count towards electives for the major: ANT 143, ANT 176, ANT 197
All anthropology majors are encouraged to take SOC 275 (Social Statistics) as part of their undergraduate curriculum, however no Sociology courses may be counted toward the 40 hours in Anthropology required for the major
Special topics courses (ANT 306 and ANT 383) vary from semester to semester may be taken twice for credit if the content is different.
All Graduate School admission deadlines and policies apply to courses for graduate credit
Minor in Anthropology
18 total credit hours in Anthropology required
Required courses
ANT 102
ANT 185
At least 9 credit hours must be at the 200-level or higher
Note: Additional Anthropology electives will be recommended on an individual basis. No Sociology course may be counted toward the 18 hours in Anthropology required for the minor.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

They also learn peace strategies to overcome persecution and transform society to attain a more just and equitable international community. The inquiry encompasses micro to macro perspectives. At the micro end of the spectrum, students investigate non-violent ethics and conflict management; interpersonal communication and relations; intergroup relations; and diversity and gender issues. At the macro level, students explore the dynamics of international conflict, as well as approaches to peace and world order; ethnic and socioeconomic justice; multiculturism; renewable economics; and biodiversity.

Advanced Marketing Analytics Sequence
The Marketing faculty have designed the Advanced Marketing Analytics (AMA) Sequence to allow Marketing Majors to concentrate their coursework in preparation for marketing roles that may require more analytical rigor which has become prevalent. The use of analytics is expected to grow rapidly. Companies will need employees who understand data that is available to them.
View Advanced Marketing Analytics Sequence Course Requirements
Advanced Marketing Analytics Accelerated Sequence
This advanced sequence is an extension of the Advanced Marketing Analytics (AMA) sequence, as it offers high achieving students the opportunity to earn a Master’s degree in Marketing Analytics by taking both graduate and undergraduate courses during their senior year and seamlessly transition into their master’s program for one additional year. Graduate-level Marketing analytics courses during their fourth and fifth year will help the Marketing Analytics 4+1 students be prepared for advanced analytics roles that require a Master’s degree and/or additional relevant experiences fit for managerial positions. The use of analytics has transformed marketing/business decision making to be more data-driven, and technical skills and experiences developed through the accelerated program allows the students to be job ready in an efficient way.

Choosing a Major
Choosing a Major
Choosing a major may be one of the easiest decisions you have ever made or it may be an overwhelming and stressful decision.
At Illinois State University, we utilize numerous resources to help you choose a major(s). University College Academic Advising is available to any student who is undeclared/undecided or who plans to change majors.
A couple quick things to keep in mind when comparing major requirements. The middle 50 percent GPA gives the range of students typically admitted into the major. Twenty five percent of students admitted have a lower GPA, so you should not view the lower GPA as a minimum required for acceptance. Also the sample plans of study provided are based on the current Undergraduate Catalog.

Learn About Yourself
The key to finding a satisfying career is matching your personality to your career choice. Understanding who you are, your likes and dislikes, is the first step. This is a process that takes some time and reflection. But your career will occupy the majority of your adult life, so it’s worth taking some time to learn what will be satisfying to you to help you make good career decisions.
People like careers for many different reasons...
Interests: Enjoying classes in this area, talking about the subject, or spending time doing related tasks.
Personal Values: Feeling energized and excited to think about making a contribution in this area, finding the career personally meaningful.
Opportunity to Use Talents: Seeing your unique talents and skills are maximized in a career. For example, you may have special talent as a writer, educator, person who empathizes with others, or leader. Careers that give you an opportunity to use those gifts will be appealing.
The more you know about a career, the better able you are to decide if you would like it. Career assessment may help you identify your interests, values and skills.
Are You Undecided or Indecisive?
It's helpful to consider whether you are undecided or indecisive. Being undecided is a normal step along the way. It usually means you need more information about yourself, educational options, careers, or perhaps how college majors relate to career options.
Being indecisive is different. It may indicate you have trouble making decisions in many areas or struggle to make a decision in spite of having information. There are many reasons you might be indecisive. Fear of making a mistake is one common reason.
You might find it helpful to speak to a counselor at Student Counseling Services if you think that being indecisive is a problem you face.
Signs You May Be Undecided
You need more information about careers
You need more information about your personality
You generally make good decisions in other areas
You are unsure what criteria to base your decision on
Recommendations
Enroll in IDS 106 - Career Choice
Enroll in IDS 128 - Thriving in College, Career and Beyond
FOCUS the online, self-guided career and education planning tool designed to help select major programs and career fields most compatible with personal interests, skills, and goals.
Meet with Academic Advisor
Consult with Career Services or Student Counseling Services
Signs You May Be Indecisive
Struggle to make decisions in many areas of life
Feel fearful of making a mistake
Postpone decisions hoping others will decide for me
Change my mind frequently
Get very anxious about making a decision
Feel unready to face the consequences of my decision
Worry about what others think of my decisions
Feel very uncertain despite having information needed to make a decision
Worry my decision will be the wrong one
Feel I never have enough information to make a good decision
Recommendations
Counseling at Student Counseling Services to address any personal issues relating to your career decision making
Selecting a major and selecting a career are different!
An employer will consider your major as just one of many factors when making a hiring decision. In addition to your major, the skills you've acquired, your personal attributes and achievements will all factor into the hiring decision. Some majors lead to a wide variety of career paths. Thus it is important to have a well rounded college experience.
Keep in mind that some careers require a specialized degree and/or certification. These areas include: teaching, nursing, geology, and speech pathology.
Many people vary their careers during their lifetime. Thus, selecting your major does not have to be a one-time decision. You may be surprised where your career takes you.
By Major
Do you have an idea of the academic areas you are interested in? If so...
Make a list of all of the major options which may be a good fit for you
Learn more about the majors and careers in your identified areas of interest
Complete some of the activities listed above which will assist you in narrowing your major options so you are ready to make your decision
By Career
When selecting your major, it is important to consider future career options. Things to consider include the following:
The difference between selecting a major and choosing your career
Various career options and the major options that can get you there
Skills that can get you to your intended career
How do I know what the job outlook for a career will be?
The Occupational Outlook Handbook is an excellent resource you can use to find out information about careers as they exist in the "real world." Click on the A-Z Index and enter an occupation that interests you. You will be provided with information such as the job outlook, earnings, nature of the work, working conditions, training and other qualifications, and advancement.
Another helpful resource for career exploration is the O*NET Online Occupational Information Network developed for the U.S. Department of Labor. This extensive online database allows for a variety of detailed occupational searches based on categories, skills, interests and much more. A number of other useful online career information resources are also linked to the O*NET Online system.
Transferable Skills
Frequently, students do not consider participation in student organizations, class projects, and volunteer work to be significant activities to put on to a resume. Then, when they begin writing their resume, they feel like they do not have experiences to write about. Quite the opposite is true!
This activity helps students identify the transferable skills they developed during college and prepares them to choose an academic major, intentionally select involvement opportunities, write a resume, and find interesting career options.
What is a transferable skill?
A transferable skill is a skill or ability acquired during any activity in life – jobs, classes, projects, hobbies, sports, internships, volunteer work, virtually anything – that can be utilized in a different setting or while participating in a different activity. The transferable skills developed throughout a college career can be evaluated to help determine what type of major, involvement activities, and even careers you may be best suited for. Employers are most interested in candidates who can build on skills developed and refined in college and transfer those skills to the “working world”.
Why are transferable skills important to identify?
Identifying specific skill sets each student possesses will help when navigating life choices ranging from academic major selection to job application. College graduates do not always have practical experience or technical skill abilities for the field to which they are applying. As you recognize skills you have gained throughout college that are similar to those used in a chosen field or industry, you will become more confident in your abilities.
Hints in identifying your own transferable skills
Transferable skills can be developed while doing almost anything! Here are some examples of ways transferable skills can be developed:
jobs and work experiences
volunteer opportunities
classes: major and non-major courses
groups you have been a part of and the leadership opportunities you have utilized
innate abilities or skills others always comment to you about such as compassion, organization, thoughtfulness, originality
Applying to a Major
Depending on where you are as a student, your process for applying to a major may be a bit different. Keep in mind, each major at Illinois State has its own unique application procedures.
Prospective Students
If you are not currently an Illinois State student and want to be, you'll have the opportunity to choose your major when you apply to the University through the Office of Admissions
Admitted Students
Students admitted to Illinois State who have not yet begun classes must contact the Office of Admissions to change your major. Please be aware, different major programs may have different admission criteria.
Current Students
Once classes begin, you will be able to apply to change your major through My.IllinoisState. Once you're logged in, click on the "Academics" tab, then on the "Apply to My Program" link.

Concurrent Admissions Program
Concurrent Admissions Program (ConAP) for Army Enlistees (Future Soldiers) is a partnership between participating colleges and universities, the Army Recruiting Command, and Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges (SOC). This program allows Future Soldiers enlisting in the Army or Army Reserve to declare their intent to enroll at a college or university at the time of their enlistment. ConAP’s intent is for Soldiers to transition directly from the Army or Army Reserves to their ConAP-selected college and puts Soldiers on track to utilize Army education benefits.
As a Future Soldier, your Army or Army Reserve recruiter can provide specific instructions on how to enroll in ConAP. Admission is deferred until completion of active duty service (after Basic and Advanced Individual Training for the Army Reserve). Please note, individuals must meet admission requirements in effect at the time of their enrollment and provide a Member 4 copy of their DD Form 214 (honorable discharge is required). Illinois State has a dedicated Veteran Admissions Liaison who serves at the University’s ConAP point of contact. This individual will acknowledge all Future Soldier ConAP requests and provide follow-up information regarding the admissions process.
For questions regarding ConAP or applying to Illinois State, please contact the Veteran Admissions Liaison at (309) 438-2181 or VetAdmissions@IllinoisState.edu.

Major in Sociology
Sociology majors at Illinois State explore a diverse range of topics and learn to think critically about the social world. Our distinguished faculty members are committed to helping students develop the analytical skills they need to gain a deeper understanding of the world in which we live.
Sociologists look under the surface of social life. They analyze data and develop theories in order to understand and explain social patterns, issues, and problems. Sociology not only helps us understand the roots of these issues and problems, but can also help inform policies that contribute to their solutions.
View Sociology Course Requirements

Degree Offered: B.A., B.S.
Major in Anthropology
Anthropology is a discipline concerned with people in their entirety: our evolution and physical variation, the remnants of our prehistoric past, the cultural and linguistic diversity of human societies past and present.
Anthropology has four subfields: archaeology, anthropological linguistics, cultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. An anthropological education begins with learning the fundamentals. This means taking courses representative of all four subfields.
Students in the Anthropology major must complete one of the following sequences.
Anthropology Sequence
View Anthropology Course Requirements
Accelerated Anthropology Sequence
View Accelerated Anthropology Course Requirements
Program Admission Requirements
The Accelerated Anthropology Sequence (AAS) is a pathway to the Master’s Program in Anthropology. Accelerated degree programs offer high-achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor’s degree and master’s degree with one additional year of study. Students accepted to the sequence will be allowed to take courses during their senior year that will count toward both the undergraduate and graduate programs in anthropology. Qualifying students must apply to the AAS in the spring semester of their junior year. Admission is based on space availability and competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures and deadlines are available on the Anthropology Program website.
Acceptance into the AAS constitutes acceptance into the Master’s Program in Anthropology and thus students will take up to 12 hours of graduate-level credits during their senior year. To transfer to graduate-only status for their second year, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the Master’s Program in Anthropology in the spring of their senior year. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing and have made good progress towards their M.A. degree during their senior year.
A maximum of 12 of the total 15 hours of elective courses may be taken for graduate credit
Some 300-level courses are offered for undergraduate or graduate credit. Students in the Accelerated Sequence who want to count a 300-level course toward their 12 hours of required graduate coursework, must enroll in the 300-level course for graduate credit at the beginning of the course in order for it to count.
To graduate in this sequence, a student must take at least one course for graduate credit during the senior year. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure approval.
Notes
The following anthropology courses may be taken by anthropology majors to fulfill General Education requirements but do not count towards electives for the major: ANT 143, ANT 176, ANT 197
All anthropology majors are encouraged to take SOC 275 (Social Statistics) as part of their undergraduate curriculum, however no Sociology courses may be counted toward the 40 hours in Anthropology required for the major
Special topics courses (ANT 306 and ANT 383) vary from semester to semester may be taken twice for credit if the content is different.
All Graduate School admission deadlines and policies apply to courses for graduate credit
Minor in Anthropology

Accelerated Master's Degree Programs
Accelerated Master’s Degree Programs
Approved 9/19/2017
Accelerated master’s degree (AMD) programs offer high achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in a faster time frame than each degree separately. Students will take both graduate and undergraduate classes when they have junior or senior status and seamlessly transition into their master’s degree program.
Students admitted into an accelerated master’s degree program may count a maximum of twelve (12) hours or 33% of course work towards both the bachelor’s degree and master’s degree. The coursework requires approval of the academic advisor. Courses must be at the 400 level or be a dual credit 300 level course in which the student completes graduate student requirements as outlined in the syllabus. Although a maximum of twelve (12) hours or 33% of coursework may be shared, some programs have lower limits. Students will complete all degree requirements in both degrees.
Admission Requirements
Bachelors/Masters programs are designed to enhance the opportunities for advanced training for ISU’s most talented undergraduates. Admission to these programs must be highly competitive and will depend upon a positive review of credentials by the program’s admission’s committee. Accordingly, the admission requirements for these programs are higher than those required if the master’s degree were pursued entirely after the receipt of the bachelor’s degree. Minimum requirements include:
Declared undergraduate major
Junior based on credit hours earned
A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.20 for all course work at ISU
Students not eligible for the accelerated program may apply to the master’s degree program through the regular admissions process.
A student should apply for admission to the accelerated sequence by submitting the department required documents. Students apply to the graduate program in the semester they graduate from the bachelor's program. Some departments may have different deadlines for applications.
Students will receive conditional admission, pending the review of their grades at the conclusion of the semester of application. Once admitted to the Accelerated Master’s Degree program, students are required to meet the academic standing requirements of the Graduate School. As long as a student remains in good standing, they will automatically be admitted as a graduate student in that program.
Financial Eligibility
Students will be billed based on the degree program in which they currently exist. Students are considered to be an undergraduate student until they complete their bachelor’s degree. Once completed the student becomes a graduate student and is eligible for graduate student funding.
Withdrawal from Accelerated Programs
Students must complete at least one graduate course as an undergraduate to be considered in the accelerated master’s degree program. If the student does not complete this course, or chooses to withdraw from the accelerated program, or will not start the master’s program the next available term after completing the bachelors, they will be placed back in their original degree program.
Application for Degree Completion
The undergraduate and graduate degrees will be conferred separately. Undergraduate students will apply for and follow undergraduate commencement procedures to complete their undergraduate degree. The last semester of the graduate degree program, the student will adhere to deadlines and processes for graduate degree commencement. All details of undergraduate commencement are handled in the same manner and by the same timelines as all other undergraduate students. Once in the graduate career, students abide by the graduation deadlines set forth by the Graduate School.

Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) Program
Degree Offered: M.F.A.
The Master of Fine Arts in Art is a 60-hour program that emphasizes both theory and practice in the production, history, and teaching of the visual arts. Candidates will be expected to demonstrate artistic proficiency in at least one of the following disciplines: painting and drawing, sculpture and expanded media, printmaking, video, ceramics, photography, or glass. Candidates will also be expected to demonstrate proficiency in written and oral communication.
Students may also engage in an internship or apprenticeship. This may take the form of a guided teaching experience or work in a professional area related to the student's area of interest. The exact nature of this experience will be worked out through counseling between the major advisor and the student and will be tailored to best suit the needs of each student. This project will be subject to approval of the student's graduate committee and the School Director.
It should be understood that the accumulation of 60 semester credit hours is not the primary criterion in evaluating a student’s final achievement. The primary criterion in the evaluation of the MFA degree will be a Thesis Exhibition which demonstrates intellectual maturity and artistic proficiency in the student’s major studio area. In addition to the Thesis Exhibition, the MFA degree requires the completion of a Thesis Supportive Statement, which is a critical essay that focuses on the student’s studio work, its development, and its cultural and historical references. The M.F.A. Candidate will be required to pass an oral defense.
This 60-hour degree program requires:
36 semester hours must be taken in the Wonsook Kim School of Art, of these at least 24 must be at the 400 level
24 semester hours must be in the student's major studio area, of these at least 18 must be at the 400 level
Of the total required 60 hours, 12 semester hours must be taken in art history, or nine hours may be taken in art history with three hours in related areas such as aesthetics, philosophy, or anthropology, or ART 494 MFA Seminar
3 hours: ART 494 MFA Seminar. Taking the MFA Seminar to satisfy Art History requirements does not substitute for this requirement (494 is included within the 36 hours)
6 hours: ART 496 M.F.A. Exhibition and Supportive Statement. This will involve a comprehensive exhibition of studio work, an exhibition-related written project, and a comprehensive oral examination. A candidacy review must take place before a student can enroll in ART 496 or schedule the MFA exhibition and must include approval of proposal for the supportive statement. (496 is included within the 36 hours.)
The School reserves the right to keep images of original work produced by graduate students for educational and archival purposes.

Master of Fine Arts
Master of Fine Arts
Degrees Offered
Offered in the Wonsook Kim School of Art and the School of Theatre and Dance, the Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a terminal degree that emphasizes theory and practice in a particular discipline of the arts. 
Curriculum Requirements
Approved 11/19/87
A professionally oriented program, the M.F.A. requires a minimum of 60 semester hours for a student with only a bachelor's degree or a minimum of 32 hours for a student with an earned master's degree. The total hours required for a student with an earned master's degree will be based on an evaluation of the student's portfolio and academic record. However, the final determination will not be made until the student has completed a minimum of six semester hours in the student's major area of emphasis. A candidate for the degree must demonstrate proficiency both as a practitioner and a teacher in one of several areas of emphasis listed in the Graduate Catalog.
Time Limitations
Approved 11/19/87, Updated 3/22/01
All requirements for the Master of Fine Arts degree must be completed within eight calendar years, beginning with the date the student first registers as a degree student. This time limit applies to enrollment in all graduate coursework in the student’s program, including work for which transfer credit is allowed. If a course taken to complete the requirements for the M.F.A. degree is not taken within the eight year period allowed for the degree program, the student’s school may require the student to retake the course for credit or allow the student to demonstrate current knowledge of the subject matter. If the latter is used, currency must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the school offering the course through successful completion of an appropriate examination or other assessment if available from the school. Otherwise, outdated coursework must be deleted from, and other coursework must be substituted in, the degree audit. Credits more than eight years old at the time of first registration into a degree program are not transferable from other institutions. When graduate study is interrupted by military service or other contingencies, the eight-year limit may be extended by the Graduate School. Use the Request to Extend Time to Complete Masters/Doctoral Degree Program form at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms. 
Transfer Credit
Approved 11/19/87, Updated 3/22/01
Credits more than eight years old at the time of first registration into a Master of Fine Arts degree program are not transferable from other institutions. The work must not form part of a completed degree program elsewhere. Under special circumstances, the Graduate School may allow a student to present a larger number of credits if recommended by the school. A student who plans to take work elsewhere should obtain prior approval indicating that the course or courses are appropriate to the student’s curriculum at Illinois State University.
To be considered for transfer of credit, a course must meet the criteria outlined on the Transfer of Credit form and obtain approval from the Graduate School. The Transfer of Credit form is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
In the Wonsook Kim School of Art, a student can transfer no more than nine semester hours of credit from any graduate program (including a master's program in Art at Illinois State University) for use in meeting the requirements of the M.F.A. degree. In the School of Theatre and Dance, a student who does not have an earned master's degree may present a maximum of six semester hours of credit from another college or university for use in meeting the requirements of the M.F.A. degree. However, the student may present all earned hours from a master's program in Theatre at Illinois State for use in meeting these requirements. A Theatre student who has an earned master's degree must earn a minimum of 32 hours in the M.F.A. program at Illinois State University.
Residency Requirement
Approved 11/19/87
A student without an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least four semesters with at least two of them being full-time, consecutive semesters. A student with an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least two full-time, consecutive semesters. Summer session may be counted toward the two consecutive semester requirement only in the School of Theatre and Dance.
Admission to Candidacy
Approved 11/19/87
In order to be admitted to candidacy, the student without an earned master's degree must have completed 24 hours of graduate study at Illinois State University or two semesters of full-time resident study.
The student with an earned master's degree must have completed 12 hours of graduate study at Illinois State University or one semester of full-time resident study. All students must have a grade average of B or better with no more than 5 (6 in Theatre) hours below a grade of B.
Before becoming a candidate for the M.F.A. in Art the student must pass a candidacy review that includes approval of the following items: portfolio of studio work, final Degree Audit, and proposal for the Supportive Statement (an exhibition-related written project).
Before becoming a candidate for the M.F.A. in Theatre the student must have a Degree Audit on file with the Graduate School and pass a qualifying examination which is administered by the student's M.F.A. portfolio committee. Admission to candidacy, which usually occurs in the final semester, must be satisfied before the student is allowed to schedule an exit portfolio presentation. The Degree Audit form is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms. 
Academic Advisors
Approved 11/19/87
In the Wonsook Kim School of Art, the student in the pre-candidacy phase of the program selects a major advisor with the help of the Graduate Coordinator/Director. With the help of the major advisor the student selects a candidacy review committee of three members. The chairperson of this committee must be from the student's major area of emphasis. Normally, the candidacy review committee continues as the student's graduate committee during the candidacy phase of the program.
In the School of Theatre and Dance the director, in consultation with faculty whom the director deems appropriate, will select the candidate's Portfolio Committee. The committee chairperson must come from the student's major area of emphasis.

An ACEND Verification Statement of DPD Completion will be given to students completing this sequence meeting program requirements. This official statement is required for graduates to begin an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after acceptance, and for other professional applications requiring verification of DPD completion. The DPD program at Illinois State University is currently accredited by the ACEND of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ACEND is recognized by the United States Department of Education and can be contacted at 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 800-877-1600, Ext 5400.

Dietetics Accelerated Sequence
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in Dietetics/Family and Consumer Sciences. Students can then apply to the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors. All accreditation information for the Dietetics Sequence applies to the Dietetics Accelerated Sequence. Students in the Dietetic Accelerated Sequence are encouraged to apply to ISU’s Track Two Dietetic Internship during the Spring Match in their senior year. The Dietetic Internship would take place following the senior year and be incorporated into the master’s degree.
Program Admission Requirements for New and Continuing Students: High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree.

Food and Beverage Management Sequence
The Food and Beverage Management sequence prepares graduates for careers in the growing food industry by combining business and management principles with food service and hospitality skills. This sequence requires fewer science courses (no organic and biochemistry) and more business and food-related courses than the dietetics sequence. Consumers spend about 50 percent of their food dollars in restaurants, cafeterias, fast-food franchises, at work, or at school. Food systems managers organize these operations and make sure the foods are attractive, nutritious, and safely prepared. This sequence meets the requirements to become eligible to take the Certified Dietary Manager Credentialing Exam. Popular career options include restaurant manager, cafeteria manager, caterer, and corporate, hospital, long-term care, or school food service manager. Employment opportunities also exist with companies that produce food, food ingredients, or processing equipment, and food safety inspection, food sales, marketing, and business management.

Major in Interior Design
The Interior Design (ID) program at Illinois State University offers two sequences: Interior Design Sequence, and Interior Design Accelerated Sequence, which is a pathway to the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program.
Interior Design Sequence
The Interior Design program prepares students to design innovative, functional, supportive, and responsible interior environments that positively impact the quality of life within a global market. The curriculum develops students’ skills and knowledge in design, sketching and technical drawing, space planning, interior construction and building systems, materials specifications, historical interiors, building codes and accessibility guidelines. Sustainability issues and universal design are emphasized. The program is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA) and focuses on the broad range of specialties within commercial interior design. Course content is based on the knowledge and skills needed to pass the National Council for Interior Design Qualification certification exam. To be licensed in the State of Illinois, graduates of a 4-year CIDA-accredited program must have a minimum of two years professional work experience and pass the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) Examination. Passage of this exam also qualifies the individual for professional membership in interior design organizations such as International Interior Design Association (IIDA) and American Society of Interior Designers (ASID).

A grade of C or better is required in all the following Chemistry courses: CHE 140, CHE 141, CHE 215, CHE 216, CHE 230, CHE 231, CHE 232, CHE 250, CHE 251, CHE 242 or CHE 342, CHE 360, CHE 361. 
The department strongly recommends students take at least 6 credit hours of advanced electives in the major. 
A chemistry or math course in the major may not be attempted more than twice during a student’s undergraduate career. An exception may be requested only once for only one course during a student's undergraduate career if the GPA in the major plan is 2.00 or higher, and the overall GPA is 2.00 or higher. A student who does not complete the course with a grade of C or better on the third attempt will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Any student who would need an additional third enrollment to enroll in any other required chemistry or math course in the major will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Each attempt in which the student receives a grade, including a grade of WX, is counted as an attempt.

Illinois State University’s Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders completes criminal background checks for all candidates for the Master’s Program in Speech-Language Pathology and the Doctoral Program in Audiology and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic records, and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon completing and passing a national background check. The department may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to a CSD graduate program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some clinical placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the advanced degree. Many clinical sites require criminal background checks for accepting a student clinician in their setting. It is the student’s responsibility to inquire with the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to a graduate program in CSD, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders. Students must meet the professional and ethical standards set forth by the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders.
In addition to the requirements of the Graduate School, the degree students must meet all the academic requirements and clinical practicum requirements for the Certificate of Clinical Competence of the American Speech-LanguageHearing Association. Copies of requirements for both Illinois and national certification 
can be found online. The graduate programs are accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation.
Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.00 in major courses and overall to retain their degree status and to be eligible for department clinicals. Enrollment by graduate students in the department's clinicals requires degree status. In all instances, permission of the Clinic Director is needed for practicum enrollment, and enrollments may be restricted. External graduate clinicals may require special coursework and will require a student to provide transportation to external settings arranged by the department.
A candidate for the master's degree must 
complete two external placements
 in order to qualify for the degree. A degree student in the Doctor of Audiology program must spend one year in residency in order to qualify for the degree. A year in residence is interpreted as three consecutive semesters
 of enrollment in CSD 598.90 for one credit hour each semester.

Notes
Enrollment in 200-level business courses requires 45 completed credit hours. Enrollment in 300-level business courses requires 75 completed credit hours.
Courses for the language requirement and area studies requirement are often able to also meet general education requirements. Thus, careful consultation early in the IB program can reduce the number of hours needed to complete it.
IB majors are required to have an international experience consisting of a least one month abroad for a study abroad or an international internship. If this is a concern, there is an exemption process through the Director of the Carson and Iris Varner International Business Institute.

Invested in those with greatest financial need
For many years, Illinois State has invested heavily in our students with the greatest financial need. We continue to provide nearly $13 million in ISU Access Grants annually to serve students from families in the lowest income levels. Combined with MAP and Pell Grants, these students generally pay little or nothing for tuition and fees. In many cases, the Pell Grant can also cover a portion of students' housing charges.

Freshman Admission Requirements
Our commitment to individual attention reaches beyond the classroom into the admissions process. To determine your academic preparedness and fit, all elements of your application will be reviewed carefully by a University professional.
Highest admission priority will be granted to students with the strongest academic records.
What Admissions Considers
High school courses completed
Grade point average
SAT/ACT scores and subscores (if submitted)
Optional academic personal statement
Academic Completion
You are required to complete a core high school curriculum that includes:
English - 8 semesters
Emphasizing written and oral communications and literature
Mathematics - 6 semesters 
 We encourage college readiness courses like algebra, geometry, trigonometry, or fundamentals of computer programming.
Science – 4 semesters  with laboratories
Emphasizing natural science or agricultural science
Social science – 4 semesters 
Emphasizing history and government
Foreign language/Fine arts – 4 semesters 
Any combination of four semesters of a language and/or fine arts, including art or music.
Grade Point Average
You’ll be required to submit a self-reported grade point average.
The middle 50% range for fall 2024 admitted freshmen was 3.3 – 4.0.
 Academic Personal Statement
All applicants are welcome to submit a personal statement for review, though it is not required to complete your application. This statement may be considered along with other application materials to determine eligibility for admission. If you opt not to submit a statement and further review is needed to make an admission decision, we will request a personal statement from you at that time.
If you would like to submit a personal statement, your submission should be approximately 500 words in length and address the contributions you are prepared to make to our community, both academically and otherwise. Specifically, your statement should:
Identify any circumstances that affected your high school academic performance, if applicable
Make clear your commitment to academic success in college, acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses and your plans to utilize available resources
Articulate your readiness to engage productively in our campus community outside the classroom
Standardized Test Scores
You are not required to submit a standardized test score as part of your application for admission.
You will still have the option to submit an SAT or ACT score—and if you were to do so, it could not affect your standing negatively.
Applicants who opt not to include an SAT or ACT score will be required to submit a high school transcript in order to complete their application for admission. For students whose application requires further review, additional information such as an academic personal statement may be requested.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

General Education Requirements
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
The first way is to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program (see below for details).

Illinois State University's General Education Program
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours). Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses. Depending on their major, students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major.

Submit Enrollment Deposit

In addition to paying online, we offer the alternative option for deposit submission by sending a check or money order payable to Illinois State University. Please include the student's UID number and indicate "Enrollment Deposit" with the payment.

Look for an email invite from Illinois State once you've been admitted.
Attend Preview
Preview is the two-day summer orientation and registration program required for freshmen students and their families. Students who submit an enrollment deposit will be invited to sign up for Preview beginning April 1.
Students meet with an academic advisor, register for classes, get to know current students and future classmates, and meet faculty and staff from various departments.

If you will have Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate test scores, please submit them to the University Registrar to receive appropriate college credit.
Purchase Technology
Technology is crucial to success in today’s college environment. Whether it’s late-night studying, group projects, or streaming TV shows—you need a computer that meets your needs.

Languages, Literatures and Cultures
Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language. 
For information about admission to this program visit the University’s Academics website.

FERPA
Notification of Rights Under FERPA for Postsecondary Institutions:
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include:
(1) The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access.
A student should submit to the University Registrar a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.
(2) The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA.
A student who wishes to ask the University to amend a record should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed.
If the University decides not to amend the record as requested, the University will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student’s right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.
(3)  The right to provide written consent before the University discloses personally identifiable information from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.
The University discloses education records without a student’s prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using University employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.
A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the University.
Upon request, the University also discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.
(4)  The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is:
Family Policy Compliance OfficeU.S. Department of Education400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC  20202-5901
(5) Illinois State University will, upon written request, disclose to the alleged victim of any crime of violence or a nonforcible sex offense, the results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by the institution against a student who is the alleged perpetrator of such crime or offense. If the alleged victim is deceased as a result of the crime or offense, the information shall be provided, upon request, to the next of kin of the alleged victim.
Public Notification of Directory Information
At its discretion, Illinois State University may provide “directory information” in accordance with the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). Directory information is defined as that information which would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Designated directory information at Illinois State University includes the following: student’s name*, address (local and home), Illinois State University email address, place and date of birth (month and day only), major field of study, dates of attendance, grade level, enrollment status (e.g. undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time), participation in officially recognized activities or sports, weight or height of members of athletic teams, target graduation date, degrees, honors and awards received, and the most recent educational agency or institution attended. Students may block the public disclosure of directory information by notifying the Office of the University Registrar in writing prior to the first day of classes.
Please consider very carefully the consequences of a decision to withhold directory information. A non-disclosure block will call for Illinois State University not to release any of this “directory information;” thus, any future requests for such information from non-institutional persons or organizations will be refused.
Illinois State University will honor your request to withhold directory information but cannot assume responsibility to contact you for subsequent permission to release this information. Regardless of the effect upon you, Illinois State University assumes no liability as a result of honoring your instructions that such information be withheld.
Although the initial request may be filed at any time, requests for non-disclosure will be honored by the University until removed, in writing, by the student.
*The name included on the student’s ISU application (the student’s legal name) is the name used for directory information purposes. If a student has also entered a preferred name in the Campus Solutions and/or HR system, that preferred name will be used ONLY for specific internal University operations and will not be used as directory information. To change your name for directory information purposes, you must change your legal name in the system. Information on how to do this is available at the University Registrar website or by contacting the Registrar directly at (309) 438-2188. If you are also an employee, information on how to change your legal name for employment purposes, is available on the Human Resources website or by contacting them directly at (309) 438-8311. Questions regarding use of a preferred name should also be directed to the above offices.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct. The University also reserves the rights to establish additional requirements with respect to specific University venues.

Continue to engage in behaviors prohibited in this section after a University official or University Police has declared that the conduct violates University policies or an applicable law and has instructed the participants to modify or
    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

General Education Requirements
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
The first way is to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program (see below for details).

Illinois State University's General Education Program

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

This interdisciplinary minor prepares students to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in their communities. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world. The minor gives students opportunities to sharpen their analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action. The minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden their learning experience and career perspectives.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

 Minor in Ethnic Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies. 
18 credit hours required
Take 6 courses as indicated below from the following groups (at least 4 courses must be above the 100 level). With consent of the faculty advisor, students may use departmental or IDS 287, 298, or 398 courses for one course in Group II and/or one course in Group III.

The MBA degree assumes an undergraduate knowledge base in business and economics which students with undergraduate degrees in business will normally have acquired.
Students admitted with nonbusiness undergraduate degrees may have to complete Pre-MBA Program courses before enrolling in the MBA core courses. Specific requirements will be determined by the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Curriculum (hereafter referred to as "Associate Dean"). The responsibility for demonstrating prior academic coverage of the material at the appropriate level rests with the student and should be completed at least one month prior to the beginning of the first semester of course work. Students who have not taken college algebra, economics, accounting, finance, and/or statistics within the past five years are strongly encouraged to take the Pre-MBA Program courses as a refresher prior to their first core course.
Students with a non-business undergraduate degree should expect to complete some or all of the following Pre-MBA Program courses online. 
Fundamentals of Economics 
Financial Accounting
Managerial Accounting 
Principles of Management 
Principles of Marketing 
Business Math and Statistics 
Understanding Corporate Finance 
Business Law Essentials
In addition to any Pre-MBA Program courses required, some or all of which may be waived based on an individual's previous academic work, all MBA candidates must complete one of the following sequences:
Traditional MBA Sequence
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416 
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450; Students who have successfully completed 12 or more undergraduate semester hours in a required core area may be eligible to substitute a 400-level elective in that area for the required core course. 
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485 
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. (Graduate courses at the 300-level may not be taken to fulfill the MBA elective requirements). In consultation with a Master of Business Administration advisor, students can choose from among a wide offering of elective courses to design a Plan of Study. The choice should be congruent with each student's goals. Elective courses are offered based on student demand. Elective courses taken outside the College of Business require prior approval by the Associate Dean and often involve additional course work to fulfill prerequisites.

Repetition of Courses in the MBA Program

Notes
A maximum 6 hours of POL 398a01, IDS 398a02 and LGS 398a20 may count toward major.
Accelerated master 's degree (AMD) programs offer high achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor 's degree and master 's degree in a faster time frame than each degree separately. Students will take both graduate and undergraduate classes when they have junior or senior status and seamlessly transition into their master 's degree program. Students admitted into an accelerated master 's degree program may count a maximum of twelve (12) hours or 33% of course work (whichever is higher) towards both the bachelor 's degree and master 's degree. The coursework requires approval of the academic advisor.
Students must complete at least one graduate course as an undergraduate to be considered in the accelerated master’s degree program. If the student does not complete at least one graduate course, or chooses to withdraw from the accelerated program, they will be placed back in their original degree program.

High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in Creative Technologies. Students can then apply to the Creative Technologies graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Creative Technologies graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the Creative Technologies Program advisor.

Notes
For History (B.A.) – Students are encouraged to complete a minor, but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than History or a Foreign Language, with at least three credit hours at the senior college level.
For History (B.S.) – Major requirements are the same as for the B.A. except students must complete a minor.
* It is encouraged for students to take courses approved for graduate credit. For 300-level and 400-level courses approved for graduate credit see courses listed with (GRAD) at the History Course Directory.
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in History. In addition to the HIS 497 required course, students may choose to take up to 9 hours of graduate level electives to count towards the 9 credit hours of additional senior college level History electives required for the undergraduate program. It is strongly recommended that one of these courses be HIS 496, another required course for the MA/MS degree. Refer to the Course Finder website for 400-level graduate courses and 300-level courses that are approved for graduate credit. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure graduate-level approval. For information on graduate-level history requirements, please visit the graduate academic catalog.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

 Minor in African-American Studies 
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The Minor in African-American Studies provides an interdisciplinary approach to the examination of black politics and life in the United States. This program is designed to be of interest to students who want to explore the many contributions African-Americans have made to the political, historical, social, and artistic fabric of the United States. Students are required to take a core of two courses on African-American history and literature, as well as elective courses in the social sciences (History, Sociology, and Politics and Government) and in the humanities and fine arts (English, Music, and Theatre and Dance), and in interdisciplinary programs (including relevant course offerings in Interdisciplinary Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies).

It is therefore designed as a multi-disciplinary program where the student will take courses in the social sciences, arts, and humanities (English; Geography; History; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; Music; Politics and Government; Sociology/Anthropology; and Theatre and Dance). The Minor will provide students with a broad background in African history, societies, culture, and politics. The program is directed towards students with a view of visiting or working in Africa or those who are interested in government or public service careers.

There are a number of study abroad programs in which students can participate that range in length from a summer to a semester, or an entire academic year. Interested students should contact the Office of International Studies and Programs.
 Minor in Children's Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The Minor in Children's Studies provides an opportunity for students to enhance their knowledge of children and child culture through interdisciplinary exploration of child-related issues. This program is designed to be of interest to students who wish to pursue child-related emphases in their major disciplines, such as education, children's literature, child psychology, children's history and culture, pediatrics, juvenile justice, or social work with children, or for those who wish to learn more about the subject of childhood from multidisciplinary frames of reference.
The minor will also provide a foundation for those students who intend to go to professional or graduate school to pursue child-centered research interests.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

The Minor in Peace and Conflict Resolution Studies is an interdisciplinary program that includes courses from eighteen departments. The Minor provides a comprehensive and in-depth approach to peace and conflict resolution theories and methods. Students are required to take an introductory course, as well as one course from each of four areas of inquiry (social justice, violence prevention and conflict resolution, environmental justice, and globalization), while also specializing in one of these areas with two additional courses. The minor's capstone experience is a professional practice.
The Minor allows students to examine the causes and prevention of war, as well as the nature of violence, including social oppression, discrimination and marginalization. They also learn peace strategies to overcome persecution and transform society to attain a more just and equitable international community. The inquiry encompasses micro to macro perspectives. At the micro end of the spectrum, students investigate non-violent ethics and conflict management; interpersonal communication and relations; intergroup relations; and diversity and gender issues. At the macro level, students explore the dynamics of international conflict, as well as approaches to peace and world order; ethnic and socioeconomic justice; multiculturism; renewable economics; and biodiversity.
Students are encouraged to consult with the program director and/or advisor regarding course selection.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

After You're Admitted
The Graduate School is home to all graduate students at Illinois State regardless of the program you are pursuing. The Graduate School has a lot to offer students, including a Professional Development Workshop series, thesis and dissertation assistance, Three Minute Thesis competition, University Research Symposium, and more. The Graduate School staff are helpful resources as you navigate life as a graduate student. Let us know how we can make the most of your time as a graduate student.
Secure Your Enrollment by Paying the Deposit 
A non-refundable enrollment deposit fee (EDF) of $150 will be required for all new graduate students prior to course registration or the issue of immigration documents. Students will only pay the enrollment deposit one time. Any student enrolling in multiple or additional programs, or needing to defer to a future semester, will not have to pay a subsequent enrollment deposit.
Please refer to this webpage for more information on how to pay your EDF.
Contact your Graduate Coordinator and Review Your Degree Requirements
Your graduate coordinator is your go-to person for issues regarding graduate education in your discipline. A coordinator's responsibilities may vary from department to department, but you can expect your coordinator to oversee your advising process and academic progress, administer your academic paperwork and assist in the hiring of graduate assistants or other graduate employment.
We encourage you to review the graduate catalog to understand your degree requirements and university policies. You can review your course options which will help you determine your program plan of study with your graduate coordinator.

Know Your Funding Opportunities
We know funding plays an important role in selecting your graduate school and Illinois State is committed to helping make graduate school affordable. Graduate Assistantships are a popular source of funding for students. Take an in-depth look online at all of your funding opportunities including assistantship waivers, scholarships, and loan options.
Learn about your funding opportunities
Decide Your Living Arrangements
While the University owns and manages two apartment complexes on School Street and Fell Avenue which house upper class and graduate students without dependents, most Illinois State graduate students live off campus. With multiple off-campus housing options in the area, students are likely to find the right fit for their lifestyle. The Off-Campus Housing Database or the Illinois State Facebook community group is a good place to start to search for off-campus listings, roommates, and subleasors. It can also be helpful to talk to your department or other students in your program for housing suggestions.
Know Your Parking and Transportation Options
You can purchase a computer parking permit if you plan to drive to campus. Illinois State's shuttle bus or Bloomington-Normal public transit is free to ride with your Redbird ID card. Find out about costs, parking locations and bus service by visiting the Office of Parking and Transportation.
Visit the Office of Parking and Transportation
Register for Classes and Get Your Redbird ID Card
Discuss your plan of study with your Graduate Coordinator before registering for classes. Advance course registration is available to graduate students a few months before the semester begins. A personalized list of textbooks are available by your professors when you enroll in classes on your My.Illinoisstate.edu portal. You can obtain your Redbird ID card after you have registered for at least one class. The Redbird Card Office is located on the first floor of the Bone Student Center.
View complete registration instructions
Check Your Email
Don't forget to check your preferred email for Admission messages and your new Illinois State email address for departmental communications. Your Redbird email is your ULID@ilstu.edu which can be accessed at My.IllinoisState.edu.
Log in to My.IllinoisState
Submit Your Health Records
You must have proof of all required health immunizations on file with Student Health Services before the start of your first term to avoid a late fee and being blocked from future class registrations. A list of immunizations required by the State of Illinois and instructions on how to submit materials can be found on the Student Health Services website.
View requirements and submit immunization records
Pay Your Bill
At the beginning of each semester, you must either pay your tuition and fees in full or enroll in a monthly installment plan. You can find out everything you need to know about tuition rates, general fees, billing due dates, and payment options on the Student Accounts website.

The Food, Nutrition and Dietetics (FND) program at Illinois State University offers four sequences: Dietetics Sequence, Dietetics Accelerated Sequence, Food and Beverage Management Sequence, and Food and Beverage Management Accelerated Sequence.
Students in the Food, Nutrition and Dietetics major must complete one of the following sequences.
Dietetics Sequence
The Dietetics sequence is a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The DPD program is an integrative program that prepares graduates for careers that influence the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities through the knowledge of food and nutrition. The program prepares students for supervised practice leading to the eligibility for the CDR credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist. This sequence provides the first step for students wanting to become a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). To become an RDN, students must apply for an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after graduation, and, upon completion, are eligible to take the registration examination. Beginning January 1, 2024, a minimum of a master’s degree will be required for eligibility to take the registration examination for dietitians. An ACEND Verification Statement of DPD Completion will be given to students completing this sequence meeting program requirements. This official statement is required for graduates to begin an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after acceptance, and for other professional applications requiring verification of DPD completion. The DPD program at Illinois State University is currently accredited by the ACEND of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ACEND is recognized by the United States Department of Education and can be contacted at 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 800-877-1600, Ext 5400.
View Dietetics Sequence Course Requirements
Dietetics Accelerated Sequence
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in Dietetics/Family and Consumer Sciences. Students can then apply to the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors. All accreditation information for the Dietetics Sequence applies to the Dietetics Accelerated Sequence. Students in the Dietetic Accelerated Sequence are encouraged to apply to ISU’s Track Two Dietetic Internship during the Spring Match in their senior year. The Dietetic Internship would take place following the senior year and be incorporated into the master’s degree.
Program Admission Requirements for New and Continuing Students: High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree.

Food and Beverage Management Sequence
The Food and Beverage Management sequence prepares graduates for careers in the growing food industry by combining business and management principles with food service and hospitality skills. This sequence requires fewer science courses (no organic and biochemistry) and more business and food-related courses than the dietetics sequence. Consumers spend about 50 percent of their food dollars in restaurants, cafeterias, fast-food franchises, at work, or at school. Food systems managers organize these operations and make sure the foods are attractive, nutritious, and safely prepared. This sequence meets the requirements to become eligible to take the Certified Dietary Manager Credentialing Exam. Popular career options include restaurant manager, cafeteria manager, caterer, and corporate, hospital, long-term care, or school food service manager. Employment opportunities also exist with companies that produce food, food ingredients, or processing equipment, and food safety inspection, food sales, marketing, and business management.

Accelerated Master's Degree Programs
Accelerated Master’s Degree Programs
Approved 9/19/2017
Accelerated master’s degree (AMD) programs offer high achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in a faster time frame than each degree separately. Students will take both graduate and undergraduate classes when they have junior or senior status and seamlessly transition into their master’s degree program.
Students admitted into an accelerated master’s degree program may count a maximum of twelve (12) hours or 33% of course work towards both the bachelor’s degree and master’s degree. The coursework requires approval of the academic advisor. Courses must be at the 400 level or be a dual credit 300 level course in which the student completes graduate student requirements as outlined in the syllabus. Although a maximum of twelve (12) hours or 33% of coursework may be shared, some programs have lower limits. Students will complete all degree requirements in both degrees.
Admission Requirements
Bachelors/Masters programs are designed to enhance the opportunities for advanced training for ISU’s most talented undergraduates. Admission to these programs must be highly competitive and will depend upon a positive review of credentials by the program’s admission’s committee. Accordingly, the admission requirements for these programs are higher than those required if the master’s degree were pursued entirely after the receipt of the bachelor’s degree. Minimum requirements include:
Declared undergraduate major
Junior based on credit hours earned
A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.20 for all course work at ISU
Students not eligible for the accelerated program may apply to the master’s degree program through the regular admissions process.
A student should apply for admission to the accelerated sequence by submitting the department required documents. Students apply to the graduate program in the semester they graduate from the bachelor's program. Some departments may have different deadlines for applications.
Students will receive conditional admission, pending the review of their grades at the conclusion of the semester of application. Once admitted to the Accelerated Master’s Degree program, students are required to meet the academic standing requirements of the Graduate School. As long as a student remains in good standing, they will automatically be admitted as a graduate student in that program.
Financial Eligibility
Students will be billed based on the degree program in which they currently exist. Students are considered to be an undergraduate student until they complete their bachelor’s degree. Once completed the student becomes a graduate student and is eligible for graduate student funding.
Withdrawal from Accelerated Programs
Students must complete at least one graduate course as an undergraduate to be considered in the accelerated master’s degree program. If the student does not complete this course, or chooses to withdraw from the accelerated program, or will not start the master’s program the next available term after completing the bachelors, they will be placed back in their original degree program.
Application for Degree Completion
The undergraduate and graduate degrees will be conferred separately. Undergraduate students will apply for and follow undergraduate commencement procedures to complete their undergraduate degree. The last semester of the graduate degree program, the student will adhere to deadlines and processes for graduate degree commencement. All details of undergraduate commencement are handled in the same manner and by the same timelines as all other undergraduate students. Once in the graduate career, students abide by the graduation deadlines set forth by the Graduate School.

FAQs
FAQs
What facilities and spaces can be reserved for use by the University community or the public?
A wide variety of facilities and spaces can be reserved for appropriated uses.  A listing of types of facilities and spaces as well as contact information to make reservation is available at [insert link].
How do I reserve a facility or space?
While reservation processes may differ slightly between departments and units, a person wanting to use a University facility or space should:
Contact the scheduling coordinator for the facility or space you want to use to check on its availability.  A list of facilities and contact information can be found at [insert link].
Complete the required forms to reserve the facility or space.
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the event planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (e.g., security staff; Emergency Medical Service personnel; other security; insurance requirements; and related loss prevention measures). 
Reservations for facilities and spaces are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis.  Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the event planner will work with the individual or organization sponsoring the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. 
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements.  Events may be evaluated for the likelihood and consequences of potential risks. 
The department or unit that reserves and oversees the facility or space will provide an agreement to the party requesting the reservation that defines the date, time and location for the event or activity and expectations for security, insurance, and safety regarding the event along with any additional special requirements.
The reservation is complete when the agreement is signed by both parties and all expectations and requirements are met.
How are decisions made on requests to use University facilities or spaces?
Reservations for facilities and spaces are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis.  Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the event planner will work with the individual or organization sponsoring the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. 
Risk factors associated with an event will be assessed and reasonable expectations for security, insurance, and safety provided to the party requesting use of a facility or space.  Failure to meet these expectations may result in cancelling of a reservation.
Why might my event not be approved?
The request to reserve space contains missing information, is a misrepresentation or contains false information. 
The intended use of a facility or a space is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The party requesting use of a facility or a space previously committed significant or repeated violation of Illinois State University Policies or rules governing the scheduling and use of University facilities and spaces.
The intended use of a facility or space would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The party requesting use of a facility or space does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The University does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested.  If this occurs, an Event Planner will work to find alternative dates.
Can I appeal a decision to deny my request to host an event in a University facility or space? 
An appeal of a denied request to host an event in a University facility or space may be made to the senior administrator with responsibility for that area.  A list is provided below:
Dean, Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts
Center for the Performing Arts, Centennial East, Centennial West
Director of Athletics
Redbird Arena, Horton Fieldhouse, Horton Pool, athletic fields, tennis courts
Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost
Academic buildings for non-class purposes, Lab schools (Metcalf School, University High School), outdoor space
Vice President for Finance and Planning
Parking areas
Vice President for Student Affairs
Bone Student Center, Braden Auditorium, Bowling and Billiards Center, Student Recreation Building, McCormick Hall, Gregory Street Fields, residence halls, lobbies, meeting rooms, green spaces surrounding residence halls
Vice President for University Advancement
Alumni Center, Ewing Cultural Center
What is the cost to reserve and use a facility or space on campus?
The University establishes fee rates for use of University facilities and spaces based on the relationship between the University and the person or organization using the facility.  Rental rates may vary depending upon whether the individual or organization is considered a RSO, a University organization, an Alumni organization, the public, or a nonprofit charitable organization.  In addition, the facility or space being used and the requirements for the activity affect the costs.
Can I sell merchandise in a facility or space on campus? 
Generally, the University prohibits solicitation and sales in University facilities and spaces.  Exceptions to this rule, are found in the Solicitation and Sales in University Facilities and Spaces section [insert link] of the Policy on University Facility and Space Use.
Do protests and demonstrations need to be scheduled with the University?
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities.  Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity. When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it.  When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
When would the University shut down a protest or demonstration?
A protest or assembly might be shut down by the University should the protest or assembly:
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent (a) the orderly conduct of a function or activity, including, but not limited to, classes and other instructional activities; research; study; lectures; presentations; performances; meetings; interviews; administrative business; ceremonies; or other public events; or (b) access to any room or space in which such functions or activities are being held. 
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent access to particular spaces where educational, health, or financial records are stored or located. 
Hold assemblies, demonstrations, protests, rallies, or vigils in:
Private offices or in private meetings.
Laboratories and associated facilities;
Computer centers;
Milner Library;
Indoor areas designed for study and designated as quiet spaces or facilities that normally contain valuable or sensitive materials, collections, or records protected by law or by an existing university procedure/policy;

Communication systems facilities, utility facilities, or other facilities conducting services vital to the continued functioning of the University.
Rooms in reasonable proximity to any of the above University facilities and spaces that would cause a noise disruption or otherwise interfere with University operations.
Injure persons, damage or destroy property, or threaten to cause such injury or damage.
Create safety hazards or jeopardize the safety and security of participants or others.
Occupy without authorization a building when it is normally closed or when individuals are not otherwise authorized to be there.
Construct structures on University grounds without prior written authorization from the Director of Facilities Management (or designee).

The MBA degree assumes an undergraduate knowledge base in business and economics which students with undergraduate degrees in business will normally have acquired.
Students admitted with nonbusiness undergraduate degrees may have to complete Pre-MBA Program courses before enrolling in the MBA core courses. Specific requirements will be determined by the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Curriculum (hereafter referred to as "Associate Dean"). The responsibility for demonstrating prior academic coverage of the material at the appropriate level rests with the student and should be completed at least one month prior to the beginning of the first semester of course work. Students who have not taken college algebra, economics, accounting, finance, and/or statistics within the past five years are strongly encouraged to take the Pre-MBA Program courses as a refresher prior to their first core course.
Students with a non-business undergraduate degree should expect to complete some or all of the following Pre-MBA Program courses online. 
Fundamentals of Economics 
Financial Accounting
Managerial Accounting 
Principles of Management 
Principles of Marketing 
Business Math and Statistics 
Understanding Corporate Finance 
Business Law Essentials
In addition to any Pre-MBA Program courses required, some or all of which may be waived based on an individual's previous academic work, all MBA candidates must complete one of the following sequences:
Traditional MBA Sequence
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416 
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450; Students who have successfully completed 12 or more undergraduate semester hours in a required core area may be eligible to substitute a 400-level elective in that area for the required core course. 
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485 
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. (Graduate courses at the 300-level may not be taken to fulfill the MBA elective requirements). In consultation with a Master of Business Administration advisor, students can choose from among a wide offering of elective courses to design a Plan of Study. The choice should be congruent with each student's goals. Elective courses are offered based on student demand. Elective courses taken outside the College of Business require prior approval by the Associate Dean and often involve additional course work to fulfill prerequisites.

All core and elective courses must be completed within six years from the time of taking the first core course.
Credit-Hour Limitations for Non-Business Graduate Students
While other graduate programs on campus may require and/or give elective credit for selected MBA courses, non-MBA graduate students will not be permitted to exceed 12 credit hours of MBA course work. Non-business students seeking to enroll in MBA courses will first need to obtain their major advisor’s permission to register for classes and then must submit to the MBA Office an online override request form.

Repetition of Courses in the MBA Program
A student may register officially for an MBA course (core or elective) only twice. A student who completes a course or drops a course after census day (the tenth day of the semester) may officially enroll in the same course only one additional time.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

 Minor in Ethnic Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website.

In addition, the Report contains information on other University policies and procedures related to campus security, emergency management, crime reporting, and other resources available to students. Effective fall of 2017, the University will also provide a report that includes information on campus sexual violence impacting the University community as required by the Illinois Preventing Sexual Violence in Higher Education Act. 
The Annual Security Report and Fire Safety is available on the Campus Safety and Security website at: Security.IllinoisState.edu. If you have any questions or would like to request a paper copy of the report, please contact the Illinois State University Police Department at (309) 438-8631.

New Start Program
New Start Program
The New Start program is offered to students who wish to return to Illinois State after being away for a minimum of one year and who left with less than a 2.0 grade point average.
New Start offers students many benefits upon their return. Most significantly, it allows students to begin a new cumulative grade point average upon readmission into the University. To discuss your eligibility to return via the New Start program, contact University College at (309) 438-3217.

Requirements
Students may be considered for readmission through New Start if they left Illinois State with less than a 2.0 GPA, have been away from the University for one full year (for example, a student who last attended the University the spring 2017 term cannot re-enroll through New Start until the fall 2018 term), and meet the requirements of one of the following New Start categories:
Nontraditional Student
Veteran
Community College Transfer
Nontraditional Student
Former Illinois State students at least 25 years of age may be considered for readmission through this option after being away for one full year. If they have attended any college (including their time at Illinois State) in the three calendar years preceding re-enrollment at Illinois State, they must have achieved at least a cumulative 2.5 GPA for that college work. Transfer credit will be evaluated and appropriately awarded.
Veteran
Former Illinois State students who complete at least a one-year tour of duty since leaving Illinois State and who present a discharge for reasons other than dishonorable and who haven’t attended another college or university between discharge and application for readmission to Illinois State may be considered for readmission through this option.
Community College Transfer
Former Illinois State students who earned 60 or fewer hours at Illinois State prior to enrolling at a community college may be considered for readmission through this option. To qualify as a community college transfer candidate for the New Start program, you must have earned at least 24 hours after being away for one full year, earned a currently accepted associate’s degree (A.A. or A.S.) from a community college, and have at least a 2.5 cumulative GPA since leaving Illinois State. Students pursuing this option should also meet the 
transfer admission requirements
 for their intended major. Transfer credit will be evaluated and appropriately awarded.
For more information on the three categories that qualify for the New Start program, please see the Undergraduate Catalog.
Application Process
To discuss your eligibility to return via the New Start Program, contact University College at (309) 438-3217.
In order to be considered for admission through the New Start Program, follow these steps:
Apply for admission.
Submit official academic transcript(s) from all schools attended since leaving Illinois State. Transcripts should be mailed to the Office of Admissions, Illinois State University, Campus Box 2200, Normal, IL 61790-2200.
As part of the application process, you will be asked to write a statement describing your potential to do well academically. Your statement will be reviewed along with all other documentation submitted.
Your statement should indicate your strategy for achieving academic success if readmitted to the University.
Your statement should include the steps you have taken to ensure that you can successfully pursue and complete your intended major. In addition, you should provide a summary of the requirements to be admitted into your intended major.
Your statement should be no more than 500 words.
Program Conditions
As a student returning to Illinois State via the New Start program, please be aware of the following conditions of the program.
Advisement
If you are an undeclared student, you are advised by University College Academic Advisement in Fell Hall 340, (309) 438-7604. If you have a declared major, contact your major department/school for advisement. Refer to your official letter of Admissions to verify your major.
Grade Point Average
Upon your return to Illinois State, your cumulative grade point average will be recalculated using all grades earned from your point of reentry. The New Start option impacts only your cumulative grade point average and does not change your major and/or minor grade point average. Previous credits earned are still applied toward your degree requirements and will be posted on your transcript. Additionally, all grades earned at Illinois State, including those earned prior to New Start admission, will be used in determining eligibility for graduation honors.
Major
New Start applicants may be considered for admission directly into a major, if space in the major is available and if all major admission requirements are met at the time of enrollment. If this criterion is not met, New Start students will be admitted as an undeclared student. Refer to your official letter of Admissions to verify your major.
Academic Status
As a New Start student, you are on academic probation until you reestablish a cumulative grade point average that is above a 2.0/4.0. All New Start students are required to participate in Project Success. If your cumulative grade point average drops below a 2.0/4.0 at any point in your academic future at Illinois State, you will be dismissed from the University. Please be aware that you may only exercise the New Start option one time.
Course Load
As a student on academic probation, it is strongly recommended that you discuss your course load with your academic advisor. Additionally, you are encouraged to consider your ability to balance your course load with other obligations (i.e. work schedule, family, etc.) to ensure your personal academic success. Therefore, it is strongly suggested to enroll in no more than 14 credit hours.
Catalog Year
You will follow the Undergraduate Catalog in effect at the time you are returning to the University as a New Start student.
Graduation Hours
To be eligible for graduation, you must earn at least 30 semester hours at Illinois State after returning as a New Start student. You will need to discuss graduation requirements with your advisor.

Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of History participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors and one interdisciplinary major at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the Major in European Studies and the following minors: African-American Studies; African Studies; Classical Studies; European Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies; Native American Studies; Urban Studies; and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Program section.
Major in History
Admission to the History major, including the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, may be restricted by the lack of available Department resources.
The Department of History encourages stu­dents seeking a bachelor’s degree to develop both global and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of history and to apply these methods to their studies in other disciplines. To develop their skills in historical analysis and to learn to think critically about histori­cal accounts, students complete HIS 100, HIS 200, and HIS 300. To acquire both a well-rounded and a global understanding of historical processes, students are required to take 6 hours each in the 3 fields of European, non-Western, and United States History.
The Department of History recognizes the value of language to the study of history from a global perspective. For this reason, the department recommends that all students majoring in history complete a Bachelor of Arts program. Those students majoring in history but choosing to pursue a Bachelor of Sciences program must complete a minor program.
Students in the History major must complete one of the following sequences.
General History Sequence
B.A. students are encouraged to improve their career opportunities by minoring in another discipline. B.A. students not opting for a minor must choose an area of concentration by taking a minimum of 9 hours in any field other than history or foreign language; at least 3 of these hours must be in 200- or 300-level courses. B.A. students are encouraged to continue their language studies beyond the 12 hours required by the Bachelor of Arts.
B.A. and B.S. students in either the History (non-teaching) or History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence must complete HIS 100 during their freshman year as History majors and should complete HIS 200 before enrolling in any 300-level History course. HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen. Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor. HIS 300 is a capstone course to be taken in the student’s last full semester on campus. For students in the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, this would be the semester just prior to student teaching.
6 hours of non-Western History listed in group 3 of “History Courses by Group for the Major.” At least one of the non-Western electives must be at the senior level.
HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen, Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor.
B.A. students are encouraged to complete a minor; but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than history or foreign language, with at least 3 hours at the 200-or 300-level.
B.S. students must also complete a minor.
View General History Sequence Course Requirements
General History Accelerated Sequence
High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate programs in History. Students can then apply to the History graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the History graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the History Department advisor.

Students in the Food, Nutrition and Dietetics major must complete one of the following sequences.
Dietetics Sequence
The Dietetics sequence is a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The DPD program is an integrative program that prepares graduates for careers that influence the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities through the knowledge of food and nutrition. The program prepares students for supervised practice leading to the eligibility for the CDR credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist. This sequence provides the first step for students wanting to become a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). To become an RDN, students must apply for an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after graduation, and, upon completion, are eligible to take the registration examination. Beginning January 1, 2024, a minimum of a master’s degree will be required for eligibility to take the registration examination for dietitians. An ACEND Verification Statement of DPD Completion will be given to students completing this sequence meeting program requirements. This official statement is required for graduates to begin an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after acceptance, and for other professional applications requiring verification of DPD completion. The DPD program at Illinois State University is currently accredited by the ACEND of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ACEND is recognized by the United States Department of Education and can be contacted at 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 800-877-1600, Ext 5400.

The department strongly recommends students take at least 6 credit hours of advanced electives in the major. 
A chemistry or math course in the major may not be attempted more than twice during a student’s undergraduate career. An exception may be requested only once for only one course during a student's undergraduate career if the GPA in the major plan is 2.00 or higher, and the overall GPA is 2.00 or higher. A student who does not complete the course with a grade of C or better on the third attempt will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Any student who would need an additional third enrollment to enroll in any other required chemistry or math course in the major will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Each attempt in which the student receives a grade, including a grade of WX, is counted as an attempt.

Financial Aid
Financial Aid
Students who attend the University may be eligible to receive financial aid in the form of loans, scholarships, tuition waivers, grants and employment. In addition to funds received through gift aid and loans, many Illinois State students seek employment to help cover expenses.
Students interested in applying for financial assistance may contact the Financial Aid Office.
All students are encouraged to apply for financial aid by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This application determines eligibility for state, federal and institutional financial aid, including federal student loans.
Undocumented students who are not eligible for federal financial aid and not eligible to complete the FAFSA may complete the Alternative Application for Illinois Financial Aid to be considered for state and institutional financial aid.
Financial aid counselors are available Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. In addition, you may access information on the Financial Aid Office website.
Institutional and Financial Assistance Information for Students
The law (the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, and regulation 34 CFR 668) requires Illinois State University to notify enrolled students and the parents of dependent enrolled students annually of the availability of the following information:
your rights under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act;
your right to a deferment of repayment of your Federal Direct Loan for Peace Corps or volunteer service;
financial aid available at Illinois State University;
information about Illinois State University;
the graduation rate of degree-seeking, full-time undergraduate students at Illinois State University;
an annual campus security report; and,
a report on athletic program participation and financial support data.
General Eligibility Criteria
To qualify for federal or state financial aid programs, you must:  
be a United States citizen or be an eligible non-citizen;
submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to the federal processor;
be enrolled for a minimum of 6 hours (half-time status) per semester (Students not pursuing a degree or unclassified students are not eligible for financial aid, including loans.); not be in default on a Perkins Loan or any federally guaranteed loan;
not owe a repayment to a federal grant program; and
make satisfactory progress toward a degree as defined by Illinois State University (See Satisfactory Academic Progress)
NOTE: Generally a student may not receive federal or state financial aid from more than one institution at the same time.
Application Procedures
To be considered for financial aid at Illinois State University, you must complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), or the Renewal FAFSA, based on the following time table:  
In September renewal aid applicants will be sent an email notification for FAFSA on the Web if they provided a valid email address on the current year’s FAFSA.
In October Complete the FAFSA online 
Typically the priority FAFSA filing date for Illinois State University is November 15 each year. The federal processor must receive your application by this date to ensure your application receives full consideration for all financial aid programs. Due to a federal delay in the release of the FAFSA application for 2024-2025, the Illinois State University priority filing date has been extended to April 1. If your FAFSA is received after the priority date, you will be considered for financial aid programs for which you are eligible and that have remaining funds.
The income and asset information provided on the FAFSA determines your financial aid eligibility. Be sure to use Illinois State's Title IV school code: 001692. There is no separate institutional application for financial aid at Illinois State. You will need to submit an additional application for summer aid (see Financial Aid for Summer Session).
Financial Aid for the Summer Session
If you are enrolled for at least six hours of coursework, you may apply for financial aid.  The application form for the Summer Session will be available in the Forms and Publications section of the website in early March.
Data from your FAFSA will be used to determine your eligibility for aid for the summer session. Aid funds for the summer session are very limited. Direct Loan funds are available only if you have remaining loan eligibility for your class level.
Verification
The Department of Education’s regulations require the Financial Aid Office to verify the accuracy of financial data for some aid applicants. We call this process “verification.” If your application is selected for verification, you will be notified via email and asked to provide supporting documentation. A list of requested items will also be posted to your “To-Do List” in your Student Service Center. Responding to our requests for documentation in a timely fashion is important to avoid delays in processing your financial aid offer notice and/or disbursing your financial aid.
Types of Aid Available
Federal grants and benefits
 - Federal grants and benefits are considered “gift-aid” and typically do not need to be repaid.
Scholarships
Loans
Financial Aid Disbursement
If your charges exceed your credits, you will have a leftover balance that will need to be paid. If the amount of financial aid exceeds charges, you will receive a refund of the balance.
Satisfactory Progress
Satisfactory academic progress for federal and state financial programs is based on three measures: 
cumulative grade-point average,completion rate based on credit hours completed compared to attempted,
and a maximum timeframe for degree completion.
Enrollment Changes and Financial Aid Eligibility
Enrollment Changes and Financial Aid Eligibility
Exit Information
Before you graduate, or if your enrollment status drops below 6 hours per semester, you will be sent information concerning Direct Loan exit counseling, which outlines loan repayment, consolidation, and deferment options.

The MBA degree assumes an undergraduate knowledge base in business and economics which students with undergraduate degrees in business will normally have acquired.
Students admitted with nonbusiness undergraduate degrees may have to complete Pre-MBA Program courses before enrolling in the MBA core courses. Specific requirements will be determined by the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Curriculum (hereafter referred to as "Associate Dean"). The responsibility for demonstrating prior academic coverage of the material at the appropriate level rests with the student and should be completed at least one month prior to the beginning of the first semester of course work. Students who have not taken college algebra, economics, accounting, finance, and/or statistics within the past five years are strongly encouraged to take the Pre-MBA Program courses as a refresher prior to their first core course.
Students with a non-business undergraduate degree should expect to complete some or all of the following Pre-MBA Program courses online. 
Fundamentals of Economics 
Financial Accounting
Managerial Accounting 
Principles of Management 
Principles of Marketing 
Business Math and Statistics 
Understanding Corporate Finance 
Business Law Essentials
In addition to any Pre-MBA Program courses required, some or all of which may be waived based on an individual's previous academic work, all MBA candidates must complete one of the following sequences:
Traditional MBA Sequence
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416 
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450; Students who have successfully completed 12 or more undergraduate semester hours in a required core area may be eligible to substitute a 400-level elective in that area for the required core course. 
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485 
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. (Graduate courses at the 300-level may not be taken to fulfill the MBA elective requirements). In consultation with a Master of Business Administration advisor, students can choose from among a wide offering of elective courses to design a Plan of Study. The choice should be congruent with each student's goals. Elective courses are offered based on student demand. Elective courses taken outside the College of Business require prior approval by the Associate Dean and often involve additional course work to fulfill prerequisites.
Corporate MBA Sequence (CMBA)
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485

Credit will not be given for course numbers below 400 (no 300-level graduate course will be counted in a Traditional or Corporate MBA Plan of Study). All core and elective courses must be completed within six years from the time of taking the first core course.
Credit-Hour Limitations for Non-Business Graduate Students
While other graduate programs on campus may require and/or give elective credit for selected MBA courses, non-MBA graduate students will not be permitted to exceed 12 credit hours of MBA course work. Non-business students seeking to enroll in MBA courses will first need to obtain their major advisor’s permission to register for classes and then must submit to the MBA Office an online override request form. Permission to enroll is dependent upon space availability in the requested course(s) and prior completion of prerequisites. MBA students will have priority in registration.
Courses
Descriptions of courses leading to the MBA degree are found under the Departments of Finance, Insurance and Law; Management; Marketing; Accounting; and Master of Business Administration.
Repetition of Courses in the MBA Program
A student may register officially for an MBA course (core or elective) only twice. A student who completes a course or drops a course after census day (the tenth day of the semester) may officially enroll in the same course only one additional time.

After You're Admitted
The Graduate School is home to all graduate students at Illinois State regardless of the program you are pursuing. The Graduate School has a lot to offer students, including a Professional Development Workshop series, thesis and dissertation assistance, Three Minute Thesis competition, University Research Symposium, and more. The Graduate School staff are helpful resources as you navigate life as a graduate student. Let us know how we can make the most of your time as a graduate student.
Secure Your Enrollment by Paying the Deposit 
A non-refundable enrollment deposit fee (EDF) of $150 will be required for all new graduate students prior to course registration or the issue of immigration documents. Students will only pay the enrollment deposit one time. Any student enrolling in multiple or additional programs, or needing to defer to a future semester, will not have to pay a subsequent enrollment deposit.
Please refer to this webpage for more information on how to pay your EDF.
Contact your Graduate Coordinator and Review Your Degree Requirements
Your graduate coordinator is your go-to person for issues regarding graduate education in your discipline. A coordinator's responsibilities may vary from department to department, but you can expect your coordinator to oversee your advising process and academic progress, administer your academic paperwork and assist in the hiring of graduate assistants or other graduate employment.
We encourage you to review the graduate catalog to understand your degree requirements and university policies. You can review your course options which will help you determine your program plan of study with your graduate coordinator.

Know Your Funding Opportunities
We know funding plays an important role in selecting your graduate school and Illinois State is committed to helping make graduate school affordable. Graduate Assistantships are a popular source of funding for students. Take an in-depth look online at all of your funding opportunities including assistantship waivers, scholarships, and loan options.
Learn about your funding opportunities
Decide Your Living Arrangements
While the University owns and manages two apartment complexes on School Street and Fell Avenue which house upper class and graduate students without dependents, most Illinois State graduate students live off campus. With multiple off-campus housing options in the area, students are likely to find the right fit for their lifestyle. The Off-Campus Housing Database or the Illinois State Facebook community group is a good place to start to search for off-campus listings, roommates, and subleasors. It can also be helpful to talk to your department or other students in your program for housing suggestions.
Know Your Parking and Transportation Options
You can purchase a computer parking permit if you plan to drive to campus. Illinois State's shuttle bus or Bloomington-Normal public transit is free to ride with your Redbird ID card. Find out about costs, parking locations and bus service by visiting the Office of Parking and Transportation.
Visit the Office of Parking and Transportation
Register for Classes and Get Your Redbird ID Card
Discuss your plan of study with your Graduate Coordinator before registering for classes. Advance course registration is available to graduate students a few months before the semester begins. A personalized list of textbooks are available by your professors when you enroll in classes on your My.Illinoisstate.edu portal. You can obtain your Redbird ID card after you have registered for at least one class. The Redbird Card Office is located on the first floor of the Bone Student Center.

Check Your Email
Don't forget to check your preferred email for Admission messages and your new Illinois State email address for departmental communications. Your Redbird email is your ULID@ilstu.edu which can be accessed at My.IllinoisState.edu.
Log in to My.IllinoisState
Submit Your Health Records
You must have proof of all required health immunizations on file with Student Health Services before the start of your first term to avoid a late fee and being blocked from future class registrations. A list of immunizations required by the State of Illinois and instructions on how to submit materials can be found on the Student Health Services website.
View requirements and submit immunization records
Pay Your Bill
At the beginning of each semester, you must either pay your tuition and fees in full or enroll in a monthly installment plan. You can find out everything you need to know about tuition rates, general fees, billing due dates, and payment options on the Student Accounts website.
