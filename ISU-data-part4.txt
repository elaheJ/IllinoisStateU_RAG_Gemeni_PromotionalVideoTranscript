Honors Program Requirements
Honors Seminar: All students admitted to the Honors Program will take HON 102A17:  Honors Mindset Seminar in their first semester. Successful completion of HON 102A17 (defined as earning a “B” or better) is required to continue in the Honors Program.
Grade Point Average: Honors students are required to maintain a 3.3 cumulative GPA. Students whose cumulative GPA falls between 3.00 and 3.29 will be placed on Honors Probation, which allows them the opportunity to raise their GPA while enjoying the benefits of the Honors Program. Students on Honors Probation have up to two semesters to raise their cumulative GPA to 3.30 or higher. While on probation, students must achieve at least a 3.30 semester GPA. Students who fail to meet these requirements or whose cumulative GPA falls below 3.00 will be academically ineligible to continue in the Honors Program.
Honors Participation: Honors students are required to complete one Honors Learning Experience each semester. Part-time students (enrolled in less than 12 credit hours) are required to complete one Honors Learning Experience for every 12 credit hours completed.
Honors experiences that are credit-generating may not be taken pass/no pass and must result in a grade of "C" or better.
Students who complete multiple Honors Learning Experiences in one semester may "bank" one experience to use in a future semester.
Only one Honors Learning Experience can be "in the bank" at a time.
Honors Learning Experiences are not required in the summer; however, a summer Honors Learning Experience can be banked if the bank is "empty" or can fulfill the participation requirement for the following fall semester.
A variety of types of Honors Learning Experiences is encouraged.
When students are enrolled in the following experiences, they are not required to complete an Honors Learning Experience.
Study abroad
Student teaching (registered for STT 399)
Fall semester of Professional Development School Internship
Field-based semesters for Special Education majors (not practicum)
Full-time internships (12 hours of credit)
Full-time clinical rotations (Medical Lab Science majors)
Honors Suspension: 
Students who do not complete an Honors Learning Experience and do not have one "banked" are placed on Honors Suspension for the following semester. Students lose the privilege of early registration during the Suspension semester.
In order to regain good standing, students must complete an Honors Learning Experience during the Suspension semester. Students do not have to make up the missed experience.
There is only one Suspension semester; if a student fails to complete an experience in a future semester, s/he will be ineligible to continue in the Honors Program.
Honors Program Graduation Designations
Honors Program Scholar: To achieve this designation, students must earn a minimum 3.30 cumulative GPA at the time of graduation; participate in the Honors Program a minimum of 3 semesters; successfully complete a minimum of three Honors Learning Experiences; and continue to complete an Honors Learning Experience each semester in the Honors Program through graduation. “Honors Program Scholar” is indicated on the transcript and in the Commencement Booklet. Honors Program Scholars wear red cords at commencement.

The curriculum ensures that majors gain a strong background in the basic and applied aspects of psychological science. Majors receive in-depth instruction in psychological research methods and statistical application. They also take five courses in foundational areas of psychology that provide exposure to the broad content of the discipline, historical issues, cultural considerations, and applications. Majors become familiar with careers in psychology and complete a capstone experience as they complete the program.

In order to remain in the major, all Psychology majors must have achieved the following by the time they have completed 75 hours: (1) maintenance of a 2.00 or higher cumulative Illinois State University GPA, (2) maintenance of a 2.20 or higher Psychology major GPA (based on all courses taken at Illinois State University that count towards the Psychology major), and (3) completion of all of the following courses with a grade of C or better: PSY 111, PSY 138, PSY 200, and PSY 231; MAT 113 or MAT 113a01 or MAT 120 or MAT 121 or MAT 144 or MAT 145; a laboratory science course.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Beginning freshmen must meet Illinois State University admission requirements prior to being considered into a College of Business major. Students are strongly encouraged to complete a rigorous high school math sequence as they prepare for admission into a College of Business major.
Transfer students must have met all university admission requirements (transferring from other universities or colleges) or be in academic good standing (transferring from majors within Illinois State University). The College of Business reserves the right to maintain a balanced enrollment; the number of students who continue in the program may vary from year to year depending on program capacity and the qualifications of students in the pool.
In addition, transfer students must meet the following criteria:
Students desiring to transfer with fewer than 45 credit hours completed or in progress when they apply to become a business major are evaluated based upon their college coursework, GPA (where an established GPA exists), and College of Business admission criteria for incoming freshmen.
Students desiring to transfer with between 45-59 credit hours completed or in progress when they apply to become a business major are evaluated based upon their college coursework, GPA, and College of Business admission criteria.
Students desiring to transfer with 60 credit hours or more completed or in progress when they apply to become a business major are evaluated based upon their college coursework, GPA, and College of Business admission criteria. The College requires that these transfers, in their first semester at Illinois State, complete BUS 100 with a grade of C or better and prove computer competency (spreadsheet usage, presentation software, and Web page construction) through completion of one of the following courses or their equivalents:
BIS 167
IT 150
IAI BUS 902
Course Equivalent Transfer Policies
In addition to the general requirements of the University and the College, the following policies apply to transfer students from other academic institutions seeking a business degree:
Credit for business and related courses from 2-year institutions may be transferred and applied to the business core but is limited to 100-level (lower-division freshman and sophomore) course placement.
Credit for business and related courses from baccalaureate degree granting institutions may be transferred and applied to the business core and to the major if the course for which the credit is being transferred is at the equivalent level of the Illinois State University course, contains the same course content and requires equivalent prerequisites.
Each student must successfully complete the college capstone course (MGT 385) and their major’s designated capstone course at Illinois State University and must earn at least 50 percent of the business credit hours required for the degree at Illinois State University. Please contact an academic advisor for information concerning specific majors’ capstone courses.
Academic Requirements
The academic requirements of the University apply to all of the programs in the College of Business. In addition, the following special academic requirements apply to all students in the College of Business:
Required courses in the major with grades below C will not count toward the graduation requirements of College of Business majors.
Students must have a 2.00 GPA or higher at Illinois State in order to graduate with a business degree. Business Education majors must earn and maintain a 2.50 major and cumulative GPA through graduation.
Students majoring in business must complete their senior year (30 hours) in residence at Illinois State University. Under unusual circumstances the Dean of the College of Business may grant a modification of this requirement.
Each student must successfully complete the college capstone course (MGT 385) and their major’s designated capstone course at Illinois State University, and must earn at least 50 percent of the business credit hours required for the degree at Illinois State University.
Enrollment in 200-level business courses requires 45 completed semester hours. Enrollment in 300-level business courses requires 75 completed semester hours. This policy is strictly enforced.
Students who go on probation a second or subsequent time will be dropped from the College of Business.
The College of Business strictly enforces a two graded attempt policy for any and all courses included in any business major or minor. As such, the college only allows a student to repeat a course in his or her business major or minor once. If a satisfactory grade is not earned in the second attempt, the student will be dismissed from their College of Business major or minor. Students who earn a WX grade in either attempt must apply for permission to complete a third enrollment. A student may not enroll for a third time in any required course in their business major or minor if they have already received letter grades (A, B, C, D, or F) in two previous attempts. Students pursuing majors or minors outside the College of Business that include one or more business courses as requirements will also be held to the College’s two-graded attempt policy.
Students-at-large and graduate students must apply for permission from the College of Business to register for business courses. Such students will be required to furnish official transcripts to show that prerequisite requirements have been fulfilled. Some courses in the College have restricted and/or limited enrollments and may not be an option. These students, as all non-business majors, are restricted to 27 hours of business course work.
Non-business Majors Taking Business Courses
Non-business majors are limited to no more than 27 credits of business coursework.

For History (B.A.) – Students are encouraged to complete a minor, but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than History or a Foreign Language, with at least three credit hours at the senior college level.
For History (B.S.) – Major requirements are the same as for the B.A. except students must complete a minor.
* It is encouraged for students to take courses approved for graduate credit. For 300-level and 400-level courses approved for graduate credit see courses listed with (GRAD) at the History Course Directory.
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in History. In addition to the HIS 497 required course, students may choose to take up to 9 hours of graduate level electives to count towards the 9 credit hours of additional senior college level History electives required for the undergraduate program. It is strongly recommended that one of these courses be HIS 496, another required course for the MA/MS degree. Refer to the Course Finder website for 400-level graduate courses and 300-level courses that are approved for graduate credit. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure graduate-level approval. For information on graduate-level history requirements, please visit the graduate academic catalog.

Admission/Retention Requirements
All incoming undergraduate students are initially enrolled in the B.A. or B.S. programs, depending on their interests. Those who wish to apply to the B.F.A. program do so no earlier than the first semester during their sophomore year. 
The School of Art expects regular class attendance and supports faculty members who choose to reduce course grades for lack of participation, including excessive absences.
Students seeking admission to the Major in Art must comply with criteria established by the School of Art, including submission of a portfolio of work for review by the School. Students interested in the Art History Sequence will submit a statement explaining their interest in the field, in lieu of the portfolio. Specific requirements for the portfolio and statement may be obtained from the School office.
To graduate with a Major in Art (B.A., B.S.) students must complete all requirements of one of the School of Art’s Sequences: Studio Arts, Graphic Design, Art History, or Teacher Education. They must also earn grades of C or better and maintain a 2.50 GPA in all courses taken in the School of Art, in addition to maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00. Individual sequences may have higher requirements. Courses in the Major may be repeated no more than once for the purpose of attaining the necessary minimum grade. Students may not enroll for the next course in a related series until the minimum grade in the prerequisite course is achieved. Incoming transfer students must retake courses considered equivalents to courses in the Major for which they earned lower than a grade of C. Students who do not meet these criteria will be placed on probation with the School of Art; a student placed on probation more than once will be dropped from the School.
Admission to some Sequences in Art may be restricted by the lack of available School resources, especially in times of oversubscription. 
In times of oversubscription and limitations on resources within the School of Art, some Discipline Areas may require faculty screening of students’ supportive materials before allowing individual students to enroll in the second course in that Discipline.
All Sequences in the Major in Art require successful completion of the Art History Core, the Foundations program appropriate to that sequence, a series of courses specific to the chosen sequence, and electives in Art. Students must complete all Sequence Foundations courses before being permitted to continue in one of the sequences in the Art major; gifted students may be allowed to take 200-level courses in their areas of interest during the freshman year, pending approval of the School. Students must also complete all Art History Core courses before they may enroll in 300-level Art History courses.
Students must make every effort to complete the required Foundations courses in their first three semesters in the program. Under most circumstances students will formally declare intention to enter a particular sequence in the Art major by the second semester of the sophomore year. Students will arrange to participate in screening requirements for their preferred sequence; those not accepted into competitive sequences may be reconsidered the following semester and should consult with appropriate faculty for advice before rescreening. Also in the sophomore year, students will begin enrolling in courses appropriate to their sequence of interest. In the case of the Studio Arts Sequence, this also requires declaring a specific Discipline Area in consultation with the School’s academic advisor.
Students can begin to take Graphic Design courses after they have completed the Art History core and Studio Art Foundation courses. There is no portfolio review for admission but students must have and maintain a major and cumulative 2.50 GPA. Students whose cumulative or major GPA falls below 2.50 will not be allowed to register for Graphic Design courses until the GPA has been raised to a 2.50 or higher. Consult the School of Art for further information on admission and retention in the Graphic Design sequence.
Students will be admitted to the Art History Sequence with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 and grades of B or better in ART 155 and ART 156. See the School of Art office for more information. Students will be allowed to continue in the sequence if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 2.50.
All Art majors planning to become licensed teachers must apply for and be admitted to the University Teacher Education program. Grades of C or better in all Art and Education courses, and a 2.50 cumulative and major GPA are required by the Art Teacher Education Area for admission and retention in the Art Teacher Education sequence. Continuation in the Art Teacher Education Sequence is not automatic. Students’ performance will be evaluated each semester.
The sequence in Teacher Education may also be combined with a sequence in Studio Arts, Graphic Design, or Art History. Pursuing a double sequence may require additional semesters. However, this option is strongly recommended to prepare students for teaching art. Students are also encouraged to take coursework in Urban Education and Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. 
Students may apply to the B.F.A. Degree program beginning in their sophomore year. Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the School of Art for the competitive review that is part of the admission process. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor. Students will be allowed to remain in the program if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 3.00.To graduate with a B.F.A., all Studio Arts sequence students are also required to organize and present a solo exhibition of their work during the final year. This exhibition must be accompanied by a public oral presentation, an exit portfolio and a written supportive statement approved by the student's B.F.A. faculty mentors.
Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program with a Sequence in Graphic Design must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the Graphic Design faculty for a competitive review. If a student drops below a 3.00 GPA or fails a required design course, the student will no longer be able to continue in the BFA sequence, but will be able to shift their design studies to the B.A./B.S. degree offering. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor.To graduate with a B.F.A., all Graphic Design sequence students are also required to participate in and help organize a group exhibition with the other B.F.A. Graphic Design students.

Major in Art (B.A., B.S.)
Students in the Art major must complete one of the following sequences.
Studio Arts Sequence
The Studio Arts Sequence emphasizes both breadth and depth of competence in Studio-based Art disciplines. It expands students’ horizons beyond the Foundations level with work in a variety of media and disciplines. By requiring intensive study, it develops depth within at least one Studio Discipline Area (ceramics, drawing, glass, intaglio, lithography, metal­work and jewelry design, painting, photography, sculpture, video, wood/metal or expanded media) through the completion of a specific series of courses. It likewise encourages exploration of new genres that break through traditional boundaries between disciplines and media. This sequence prepares students to work as visual arts professionals or pursue graduate studies.

Graphic Design Sequence
Students in the Graphic Design sequence develop an understanding of topics such as design research, branding and identity, information design, typography, book arts, interactive design, image making, time-based narratives, multicultural design, and civic engagement. In addition, students may gain professional experience in a graphic design internship. Internships will require a competitive portfolio review.
View Graphic Design Sequence Course Requirements
Art History Sequence
The Art History Sequence provides students a solid grounding in the history of art on both introductory and advanced levels. In addition, the sequence includes exposure to related disciplines outside the visual arts, training in foreign language, and experience in advanced research and writing skills. Together, these requirements prepare students for effective graduate work in Art History or other fields and for positions in a variety of art- and non-art-related fields. 
In special circumstances, students may satisfy the Art History language requirement with a language or languages other than “French, German, Italian or Spanish.” In such cases, the language(s) must be appropriate to the student’s plan of study and career goals. Alternate plans of language study must be approved by the Art History faculty in order to receive credit toward the sequence.
It is recommended that students select electives in courses related to Art History offered by the following departments/schools: Anthropology; English; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; History; Music; Philosophy; Theatre and Dance. Students are encouraged to consult with the Art History faculty for advice on choosing electives in Art History and other departments that will complement their own areas of interests. Faculty are also available for consultation on preparing for graduate school.
Students may combine Art History and Studio by declaring a second Sequence in Studio Arts and fulfilling all requirements for both sequences. This will include submitting a portfolio of art work for admission.
View Art History Sequence Course Requirements
Art Teacher Education Sequence
The Art Teacher Education Sequence is a program that emphasizes a comprehensive approach that supports state and national student learning standards and teaching performance standards in the visual arts. Also stressed are creative and critical thinking, studio techniques, understanding the learner and developing skills to become an effective teacher. Students completing this sequence are eligible to apply for teaching licensure with a K-12 endorsement for teaching art in the State of Illinois.

Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct. The University also reserves the rights to establish additional requirements with respect to specific University venues.

    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies.

Minor in Global Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The minor in Global Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to enrich development of students as global citizens, and to prepare them for navigating an increasingly dynamic, complex and interconnected world. The minor helps students develop a global vision by promoting awareness of significant political, economic, and social interactions and impacts of those on the world. Critically examining contemporary global issues, events, processes and trends from multiple perspectives will improve adaptability and innovative problem solving, and prepare students for careers in public, private, and non-profit organizations where global knowledge, skills and commitment to diversity and sustainability matters. At the same time, a global education can help students develop greater self-awareness of their own identities and how they are connected to the larger world. The minor is highly individualized and can be tailored to enhance many major fields of study and other minor programs.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

Major in Integrated Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Master of Professional Accountancy (M.P.A.)
The integrated B.S./M.P.A. Degrees program is primarily oriented toward preparation for professional careers in accounting. Two sequences are offered: (1) Accountancy and Information Systems, and (2) Professional Accountancy. Both sequences permit graduates of the B.S. and M.P.A. degrees to meet minimum education requirements to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination in Illinois.
The 150-hour B.S. (min. 120 hours) and M.P.A. (min. 30 hours of graduate level coursework) integrated program is designed for students wishing to complete both degrees at Illinois State University. The B.S. degree is awarded after completion of the undergraduate degree requirements and the M.P.A. degree is awarded after completion of the graduate degree requirements. The program is not designed to admit students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree.
Students must successfully apply for continuance in the B.S./M.P.A. program in their junior year. Graduate admission would take place after the student has completed approximately 90 hours. Students will be admitted who meet graduate entrance requirements, which include satisfactory performance on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), their previous academic performance, and other evidence of their ability to successfully complete the program. Admission timing is very important to successfully complete the program so students should regularly consult with their Accounting undergraduate or graduate advisor.
Courses completed in the Department of Accounting at this University with grades below C will not count toward the graduation requirements of the Integrated BS/MPA Major, but all grades of D, F, and WX in Accounting courses at this University will be included in computing the cumulative GPA.
Students in the integrated B.S./M.P.A Degrees program must complete one of the following sequences.

Advanced Marketing Analytics Sequence
The Marketing faculty have designed the Advanced Marketing Analytics (AMA) Sequence to allow Marketing Majors to concentrate their coursework in preparation for marketing roles that may require more analytical rigor which has become prevalent. The use of analytics is expected to grow rapidly. Companies will need employees who understand data that is available to them.
View Advanced Marketing Analytics Sequence Course Requirements
Advanced Marketing Analytics Accelerated Sequence
This advanced sequence is an extension of the Advanced Marketing Analytics (AMA) sequence, as it offers high achieving students the opportunity to earn a Master’s degree in Marketing Analytics by taking both graduate and undergraduate courses during their senior year and seamlessly transition into their master’s program for one additional year. Graduate-level Marketing analytics courses during their fourth and fifth year will help the Marketing Analytics 4+1 students be prepared for advanced analytics roles that require a Master’s degree and/or additional relevant experiences fit for managerial positions. The use of analytics has transformed marketing/business decision making to be more data-driven, and technical skills and experiences developed through the accelerated program allows the students to be job ready in an efficient way.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

Undocumented Students
Overview
Diversity is a core value at Illinois State University, and we welcome all applicants regardless of citizenship status. Undocumented students, with or without Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), who apply to Illinois State are treated identically to any U.S. citizen or permanent resident.

How to Apply
Undocumented students should follow the same application procedure as everyone else.
When answering the citizenship question, undocumented students should select "undocumented."
We do not require a Social Security number or proof of residency to apply. Undocumented students should leave the Social Security question blank.
Start Application
Paying for College
Illinois State University is committed to supporting undocumented students in their dream of attaining a college degree. While undocumented and DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) students do not qualify for state or federal aid through the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) due to their status, there are other resources that can be pursued to help with educational costs.
If at any time your status changes, please let the Financial Aid Office know.
To qualify for federal financial aid, a student must be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen. A DACA student can have a Social Security number, but that alone does not qualify you for the FAFSA. If you are unsure of whether or not you can file a FAFSA, you can check eligibility requirements.
You do not have to file a FAFSA to be eligible for scholarships; however, state and federal laws prohibit Illinois State from awarding need-based state or federal aid to undocumented students.
RISE Act
The Retention of Illinois Students & Equity (RISE) Act allows eligible undocumented students and transgender students who are disqualified from federal financial aid to apply for all forms of state financial aid. The Alternative Application for Illinois Financial Aid provides a pathway for these qualified students to apply for Monetary Award Program (MAP) grants, the state's largest need-based grant program for low-income college students.
Learn more about the Alternative Application
Merit-Based Scholarships
The review process is the same for all students regardless of citizenship status.
Admissions Scholarships
Departmental Scholarships
Undocumented students are eligible for Illinois State departmental scholarships if they meet the scholarship's minimum requirements. Requirements will vary, and most do not require citizenship.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct. The University also reserves the rights to establish additional requirements with respect to specific University venues.
In general, the University will not interfere with events, meetings, assemblies, rallies, demonstrations, vigils, or protests in public areas of University facilities and spaces unless participants engage in one or more of the following behaviors:
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent (a) the orderly conduct of a function or activity, including, but not limited to, classes and other instructional activities; research; study; lectures; presentations; performances; meetings; interviews; administrative business; ceremonies; or other public events; or (b) access to any room or space in which such functions or activities are being held. 
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent access to particular spaces where educational, health, or financial records are stored or located. 
Hold assemblies, demonstrations, protests, rallies, or vigils in:
Private offices or in private meetings.
Laboratories and associated facilities;
Computer centers;
Milner Library;
Indoor areas designed for study and designated as quiet spaces or facilities that normally contain valuable or sensitive materials, collections, or records protected by law or by an existing university procedure/policy;
Health care clinics, and other health care facilities;
Communication systems facilities, utility facilities, or other facilities conducting services vital to the continued functioning of the University.
Rooms in reasonable proximity to any of the above University facilities and spaces that would cause a noise disruption or otherwise interfere with University operations.

Continue to engage in behaviors prohibited in this section after a University official or University Police has declared that the conduct violates University policies or an applicable law and has instructed the participants to modify or
    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

Policies and Procedures
50 Percent Rule
Based on Higher Learning Commission Accreditation requirements, all master’s degree programs require a minimum of 50 percent of the non-thesis credit hours applied to the degree to be 400-level courses or above.
Absence of Student Due to Religious Beliefs
Any student in an institution of higher learning, other than a religious or denominational institution of higher learning, who is unable, because of their religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examination, study, or work requirement and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up the examination, study, or work requirement that they may have missed because of such absence on a particular day; provided that the student notifies the faculty member or instructor well in advance of any anticipated absence or a pending conflict between a scheduled class and the religious observance and provided that the make-up examination, study, or work does not create an unreasonable burden upon the institution. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the student such an opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of their availing themselves of the provisions of this Section.  For more information please see the ISU Policy 1.6 Religious Accommodation Policy available at: 
https://policy.illinoisstate.edu/conduct/1-1-6.shtml. 
Academic Dishonesty
https://deanofstudents.illinoisstate.edu/conduct/code/academic/
Academic Load
Approved 2/23/95; Updated 9/19/02; edited 2/6/03, 8/7/03
Students are considered full time if they register for 9 or more hours during the fall and spring semesters and 6 or more hours in the summer session. A student may register for no more than 15 hours in the fall and spring semester. In the 12-week summer session the maximum load is 12 semester hours. Fees for Student Health Insurance are automatically assessed for full- time students only. Student fees are assessed on a per hour basis. For graduate students in their final semester or on a 9-12 month internship, who have completed all coursework, and whose culminating experiences include thesis/dissertation or internships related to certification/accreditation, a full-time academic load may consist of at least one hour of thesis/dissertation or professional practice credit. Students who desire the “1 credit hour equals full time” designation must be approved for that designation by their graduate coordinator, who will contact the Graduate School for registration. Fees for Student Health Insurance will automatically be assessed for these students. 
If a student holds an assistantship the academic class load is 9 hours in the fall and spring semesters. A graduate assistant in their last semester of graduate studies who needs fewer than 9 hours to complete the degree must have a Graduate Assistant Course Load Waiver Request approved before the beginning of the last semester by their graduate advisor and by the Graduate School. Graduate assistants taking more than 12 hours must have the approval of their graduate advisor.
Note: Graduate students registering for fewer than 9 hours in fall or spring, or fewer than 6 hours in summer, will not have the insurance fee automatically assessed. Those graduate assistants must apply for the insurance through their student account on My.IllinoisState.edu before the fifteenth calendar day of each semester and the eighth calendar day of the summer session to pay premiums or within 15 days of the assistantship start date.
Applying for Degree/Certificate Completion
Approved 11/6/86, edited 9/5/03
Students must meet all requirements for their curriculum. A graduate student must apply for degree completion before the deadlines for each session as specified by the Graduate School. At the time application is made, the degree completion fee must be paid. Applications for students who fail to meet degree completion requirements for a specific session are cancelled, and the students must reapply for a later session. The application for degree completion is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Students completing a certificate program must complete the application for completion of a non- degree graduate level certificate program available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Auditing Privileges
Approved: 11/6/86
A student may register as an auditor in a class or classes if facilities are available. A class taken under the audit option does not count toward a degree; it does not count toward full-time student status for financial aid and other purposes, nor does it count toward total hours enrolled in determining registration priority. Students auditing a class will be charged all applicable tuition and fees. An auditor is expected to attend regularly. To audit, a student must obtain a Request for Auditor registration form from the Registrar Service Center or download it at Registrar.IllinoisState.edu, request the instructor sign it and return the signed form to the Registrar Service Center.
Commencement
Approved: 12/16/92; updated 4/25/02
Degrees are conferred and diplomas awarded after the close of each semester and summer session. Commencement is held twice each year at the end of each fall and spring semester. Participation is voluntary.
Graduate students who complete degree requirements during the fall semester participate in commencement exercises in December; students who complete degree requirements during the spring semester (masters and doctoral) or at the close of the summer session (master’s only) participate in commencement exercises in May.
Doctoral students who complete degree requirements in the summer session who wish to participate in a commencement exercise may only do so in the following December commencement.
All doctoral students must complete all requirements for the degree to participate in Commencement exercises.
Certificate students do not participate in University commencement ceremonies except by agreement of the College which sponsors the academic unit.
Course Registration
Help with registration may be obtained at Registrar.IllinoisState.edu or the Registrar Service Center, in 107 Moulton Hall, or by calling (309) 438- 2188. For office hours, visit the University Registrar website above. Registration may be accomplished during the advance registration period or the additional registration periods prior to the start of the semester.
Deferred Credit
Approved: 11/6/86
Deferred credit (DE) is always given in research and performance courses leading to a thesis, dissertation or exhibition. Credit (CR) will be given when the student satisfactorily completes all requirements for the program. Deferred credit (DE) is not used in computing the cumulative grade point average.
Deficiencies
Approved: 11/6/86
When an applicant has been accepted, the department/school will indicate any courses that may be required to remove undergraduate deficiencies. The department/school also may specify certain graduate courses which will be required in addition to those listed in the catalog and will designate which, if any, of these courses may be used in meeting requirements for the degree.
Degree Audit
A degree audit documents courses, credit hours, grades and other degree requirement specifics. The degree audit is to be completed no later than the beginning of the last semester in which the student is enrolled prior to graduation. The due dates are posted on the Graduate School website. A student cannot graduate without an approved degree audit on file.
Once an option has been approved on the formal degree audit, it can be changed only with approval of the student’s academic advisor. However, when a degree audit is submitted to the Graduate School in the semester of anticipated completion, it can be changed only with written approval of the academic advisor and the Graduate School. The degree audit form is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Disciplinary Hold
A student may not graduate with a disciplinary hold on their record.
Full-time Equivalency
Approved 1/27/21
If a student has completed the maximum requirement of thesis/dissertation hours for the program, but more time is needed, a student may register for a 1 credit of thesis or dissertation for up to two (2) semesters.  This 1 credit course will be counted at a level equivalent to full-time study for the purposes of loan deferment, continued use of university student services, and graduate assistant full-time enrollment eligibility requirements.  An approved PERS 938 (Reduced Course Load Request) is still required for graduate assistants enrolled in this option.
If more time is needed beyond the first two (2) semesters, a formal request for an extension can be made to the graduate school by the thesis/dissertation advisor. Extensions may be approved for a maximum of two (2) additional semesters only if a clear plan for completion has been submitted and only if the student is working at a full-time equivalency on thesis or dissertation work.  Graduate students who are using this extension cannot hold a graduate assistantship.  If the extension is approved, the full-time equivalency could be used for loan deferment or continued use of student services ONLY. 
An extension request must address the following:
An explanation of why the extension is necessary;
If the extension is being requested for one or two semesters;
Explanation of how the student is working at a full-time equivalency on thesis or dissertation work;
A timeline for completion in the requested time-frame; and
Approval of the thesis/dissertation advisor, the graduate coordinator, and the Graduate School.
Use of the 1 credit thesis/dissertation option (or extended period) may also affect the cost of attendance if a student is applying for federal and state financial aid.  Students should consult the Financial Aid department to determine how use of the option will impact the student’s eligibility for federal and state financial aid.

Good Standing
Approved: 12/5/96, revised: 12/10/99, revised: 10/16/2012; edited: 2/17/15, revised: 1/27/21
A student must remain in good standing during the entire enrollment in graduate studies at the University. Good standing includes maintaining a minimum 3.0 graduate cumulative and program GPA to graduate, satisfying any program- specific requirements for good standing, and making satisfactory progress to degree. Students who fail to meet this requirement will either be dismissed from graduate studies or placed on academic probation by the Graduate School.
Note: Campus Solutions calculates cumulative GPA for students pursuing multiple simultaneous programs. It is important individual program GPA’s are calculated manually at the department level to determine each program GPA is a 3.0 or above. Otherwise, the GPA of one program may not be at a 3.0 which is required to graduate. 
Grading System
Approved: 2/15/90; Revised 9/19/02
Instructors assign a letter grade in each course for which the student is registered and are responsible for correcting any error in grading. The grade point equivalents are 4 for A, 3 for B, 2 for C, 1 for D, and 0 for F. Courses completed at this University with grades below C will not count toward a graduate degree or certificate, but all grades of D and F in graduate courses at this University will be included in computing the cumulative grade point average. (See Repetition of Course Requirements section below.) Graduate courses are not available on Passing/Not Passing (P/NP). Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) is provided only where approval through the curricular process has been obtained.
*Spring 2020: Graduate students were eligible for P/NP due to a global pandemic.
Incomplete Grade
An incomplete (I) will be assigned to a student who is doing passing work but finds it impossible, because of reasons beyond their control (such as illness), to complete the required work by the end of the term. The student must have attended class to within three weeks of the close of the semester or to within one week of the close of the summer session. Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the University Registrar. Student will not be allowed to graduate with an incomplete on their record.
After three semesters, an incomplete is automatically changed to an F. A grade change is needed to update the grade after this point in time.
ISU Embargo Policy
Approved: 11/12/19
As a public institution, ISU is committed to public access to all graduate theses/dissertations which reflect the knowledge created through students’ scholarly research and creative activities. The Graduate School requires submission of theses/dissertations to ProQuest/UMI ETD and strongly encourages submission to ISUReD. However, ISU is also committed to students' rights as authors, allowing students to delay access to their theses/dissertations as needed. When an exception to the immediate release of a thesis or dissertation is necessary, an embargo provides a temporary, delayed public release of the work. Embargoes of 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years are available without Graduate School review. When an embargo is granted, the title, abstract, author and program information will be accessible during the restriction period. The embargo periods for ProQuest and ISUReD should be identical lengths of time.
While embargoes are not intended to be permanent, renewals of the original embargo may be considered by the Graduate School. Embargoes longer than 2 years are atypical and require review by the Director of the Graduate School and the Milner Library Copyright Officer. Renewals of embargoes should be submitted to the Graduate School within 1 month of the expiration of the current embargo. Embargos extended beyond 2 years are rarely granted and only done so in extremely compelling situations.
The request to embargo must be approved by the student’s committee chair and submitted to the Graduate School no later than the Right to Defend deadline. An embargo is requested by sending an email to the ISU Copyright Officer.
An embargo past 2 years may be considered for the following reasons:
Patentable rights are contained in the work and disclosure may be detrimental to the rights or interests of the author. The ISU Intellectual Property & Export Control Officer should be contacted by the committee chair as part of the embargo request.
To protect the copyright potential of creative works such as first serial or book rights, a documentary, music score, artwork, etc.
There is a need to prevent disclosure of government information about persons, institutions, technologies, etc. that is contained in the work.
An academic or commercial press has expressed interest in acquiring the rights to publish the work as a book.
The work contains content that has already been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal that may require an embargo. Check publishers’ policies before submitting the thesis/dissertation.
The work is based on data generated through research that will support other publications from people within the same research team (i.e. advisor). As a result, it may be necessary to refrain from releasing that data while other publications are prepared. An additional 2 years may be requested in this situation.
Making the research publicly available might endanger research subjects or the author.
Research and/or data is subject to review by sponsor or grantor prior to publication
Research falling within policy 4.1.13 Classified Research. 
Limitation of Credit for General Courses
There are limitations to the number of courses that may be taken. They include but are not limited to:

Probation
A student may be placed on probation for no more than 3 consecutive enrollment terms, at the discretion of the department/school following each term. A student who fails to return to good standing after each term will be considered for dismissal or placed on another term of probation. A student must be in good academic standing to be admitted to candidacy for a degree, as well as to graduate. Graduate students may not hold a graduate assistantship after one term of probation if the student is not in good standing.
Procedure for Appeal of Dismissal from a Graduate Program
Approved 10/29/19
Students who are dismissed from a graduate program should follow the appeal procedure outlined in the dismissal letter (summarized below). If a student is dismissed from more than one program at the same time they must appeal each dismissal separately.
To appeal a dismissal from their graduate program, a student must submit a written letter to the College Dean or designee within 5 business days from the date of the dismissal letter. The written appeal letter should clearly outline the reason for the appeal, the facts and circumstances leading to the dismissal, and a written plan with benchmarks to continue successfully in the graduate program.
Upon receipt of the appeal, the College Dean or designee will notify the School Director/Department Chair that issued the dismissal, Graduate Program Coordinator, registrar’s office, and Director of the Graduate School. The student, graduate program coordinator, and/or any other individuals that may be of assistance in the review of the appeal can be interviewed or asked to provide further written information. The intention of this step in the process is to be thorough, but timely with a response.
The student will maintain course enrollment until a decision on the appeal is reached.
After considering all available information, the College Dean will provide a written response to the student on the decision of the appeal.
If the dismissal is upheld, the student will be dropped from enrolled courses and become inactive.
If the dismissal is overturned, the student will remain in the program and any required benchmarks for continued enrollment will be communicated in writing.
Repetition of Course(s)
Approved 10/10/02; Revised by Academic Senate 12/10/03; Edited 3/19/04; Edited 5/1/06; edited 9/27/23
If a student completes a course or drops a course after the tenth day of classes receiving a grade of WX, the student may repeat that course once. Undergraduate students who are requesting a third enrollment must obtain permission from the undergraduate academic advisor. Graduate students will obtain permission from the graduate advisor/coordinator who will submit a Third Enrollment Override/Permission Request to the Registrar Service Center to allow the student to register in the course.
When a course has been repeated at Illinois State University, the most recent grade (A, B, C, D, or F) that the student earns will replace the previous grade in the cumulative GPA calculation. A grade of WX, AU, I, CR, CT, NC, P, NP will not replace the grade, nor the hours earned in the prior attempt. The previous grade(s) will not be removed from the student’s transcript, and the credit hours and grade points from only the last graded attempt (A, B, C, D, or F) will be used toward meeting degree requirements. Grades received for repeated courses at another college or university, will not replace the previous grade earned at ISU nor can it be used to improve the cumulative grade point average. However, the transfer credit may be used to satisfy a prerequisite, program, or other requirement at ISU. Courses that allow multiple enrollments have a separate grade recorded for each enrollment and each grade (A, B, C, D, or F) is counted toward the student's GPA. Previous grades are not replaced or removed from the student’s record until the maximum allowable enrollments or credit hours for the course has been exceeded. An Illinois State student considering repeating or enrolling in any classes, including extension or correspondence courses, at another college or university while enrolled at or pursuing a degree from Illinois State University should consult with their advisor. Students repeating a course to improve their GPA should be aware that many professional and graduate schools recalculate GPAs to include all courses attempted. This regulation does not apply to general courses (See Limitation of Credit for General Courses section).
Transfer of Degree Programs
A transfer from one degree program to another requires approval by the receiving and departing department or school and a formal application to the new program. Admission must be received from the department or school student wishes to transfer prior to withdrawal from current program. 
Undergraduates Taking Graduate Coursework for Graduate Credit
Approved 2/15/90, edited 10/16/06, revised 2/10/21
Undergraduates can take graduate courses for graduate credit if they (1) have junior or senior status, and (2) have a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or higher. Total registration cannot exceed 15 hours in that semester. Graduate coursework will not be calculated in the undergraduate GPA. The transcript will indicate the grade received, the number of credit hours the course was worth, but 0 hours earned. This is due to only earned hours are calculated in the GPA. This is common transcript language used by Registrar/Bursar offices. There is no guarantee graduate courses taken will be accepted by another University as transfer credit.
All coursework taken for graduate credit must be approved by the department or school advisor and the Graduate School BEFORE registration. A form titled, "Undergraduate taking Graduate Credit" is available electronically in My.IllinoisState to be completed for approval.
Up to 12 hours of coursework will count toward an ISU graduate degree program only and has a limit of 6 years to be used. Coursework taken for graduate credit cannot count toward a bachelor's degree except under the provisions of integrated bachelor’s/master’s degree and accelerated master’s degree programs. This opportunity is also extended to last semester seniors of other universities who find it possible to take graduate work at this University while completing requirements for the bachelor's degree on their own campuses. Interested students should write to the Graduate School for further information. Such graduate courses cannot be used in meeting bachelor’s degree requirements on their own campuses.

The Master of Athletic Training (MAT) degree is a 52 credit hour program and requires both classroom and clinical education. Admission to the academic program is limited and is based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Specific undergraduate prerequisite coursework is required for admission. For a complete list of prerequisite coursework, please refer to the MAT website.
Once admitted, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 on a 4.00 scale throughout the entirety of the program. A student falling below the GPA requirement will be placed on probation for one semester and removed from clinical education. If after one semester the minimum GPA has not been re-established, the student will be dismissed from the program. Students must earn a grade of “C” or better on each clinical site preceptor evaluation. Hours completed while at the site will not be counted toward the required clinical education hours if the student earns a grade below a C.

Master of Arts Degree Requirements
Approved 12/3/98, edited 3/29/05, 3/22/16
The Master of Arts degree is awarded to a student who has completed an appropriate degree program and met the foreign language requirement for this degree at the college level. This requirement may be met by:
Completing a minimum of four semesters (or its equivalent, ISU's LAN 116) in one foreign language. The requirement may be met by earning a grade of C or better (or Credit or Pass) in the courses at either the graduate or undergraduate level.
Obtaining a satisfactory score on a university administered language examination approved by the Graduate School available in French, German, or Spanish at the University College Office. View additional MAPE information.
Students whose native language is not English may, with departmental or school approval, petition the Graduate School to substitute proficiency in the English language as fulfillment of the language requirement. Proficiency is met by achieving the university or program minimum, whichever is higher, total score on TOEFL or IELTS, or Duolingo exams. Academic English Program/Pathway students who have completed Illinois State Academic English Level 5 will also qualify.
Students wishing to use American Sign Language as the language requirement may do so if they have completed 4 semesters of ASL for credit at an accredited college or university (no adult education courses). Proficiency may also be tested but requires the use of an outside consultant. A fee will be assessed if a proficiency test is needed.
Other methods as determined by the department or school with approval by the Graduate School.
Degree Options and Credit Requirements
Edited 2/17/15
The following are the degree options, however, not all programs offer both options:
Master’s Degree with Thesis: No more than 6 and no less than 4 semester hours for thesis research and writing may be counted toward satisfying the 30 semester hour minimum of graduate work for a master’s degree with thesis. Fifty percent of all non-thesis hours must be at the 400 level and above.
Master’s Degree without Thesis: Consists of at least 30 semester hours of graduate work and includes a Comprehensive Examination and/or a culminating requirement demonstrating a mature application of skills and knowledge (e.g., professional practice, project, colloquia, and recital).
Master's Degree with Courses: Consists of at least 30 hours of graduate work demonstrating skills or knowledge of content competency.
Fifty percent of the courses completed, must be at the 400 level or higher.
Time Limitations
Approved 11/6/86, Updated 3/22/01
All requirements for the degree must be completed within six calendar years, beginning with the date the student first registers as a degree student. This time limit applies to enrollment in all graduate course work in the student’s program including work for which transfer credit is allowed, as well as courses taken as a visiting student if the student wants to use the courses toward a degree. A Request to Extend Time to Complete Degree Program must be completed by the student, graduate coordinator, and, if applicable, thesis chair, and submitted to the Graduate School for approval or denial. To access this form visit Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
If a course taken to complete the requirements for the degree is not within the six-year period allowed for the degree program, the student’s department or school may require the student to retake the course for credit or allow the student to demonstrate current knowledge and/or proficiency of the subject matter. If the latter is used, currency must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the department or school offering the course through successful completion of an appropriate examination or other assessment if available from the department or school. Otherwise, outdated coursework must be deleted from, and other course work must be substituted in, the degree audit.
Credits more than six years old at the time of first registration into a degree program are not transferable from other institutions. Individual departments and schools may have more stringent timelines. When graduate study is interrupted by military service or other contingencies, the six year limit may be extended with the approval of both the department or school and the Graduate School.
Transfer Credit
Approved 10/19/95; updated 2/24/00, 3/22/01; edited 6/27/04; updated 4/28/21; updated 10/25/23; updated 11/29/23
Upon recommendation of the department or school where the student is enrolled and with the approval of the Graduate School, a student may present a maximum of twelve semester hours or 33% of graduate credit coursework, whichever is higher, from another college or university that is accredited by the appropriate regional accrediting association for use in meeting the requirements of the degree. The work may be part of another graduate degree program. Under special circumstances, the Graduate School may allow a student to present a larger number of credits if recommended by the department or school. A student who plans to take work elsewhere should obtain prior approval indicating that the course or courses are appropriate to the student's curriculum at Illinois State University. Correspondence courses and independent studies are not accepted toward a degree.
To be considered for transfer of credit, a course must be taught at the graduate level and the student must have received at least a B grade in the course. In addition, a departmental or school evaluation of all courses presented is necessary prior to consideration by the Graduate School. The Request for Transfer of Credit form is at: Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Residency Requirements
Approved 11/19/87
Except in the Wonsook Kim School of Art and Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, a candidate for a master's degree is not required to complete a residency requirement. For specific requirements of the department or school refer to the department or school program description.
Admission to Candidacy
Approved 11/19/87; edited 2/17/15
To be admitted to candidacy for the master's degree the student must have: a) a Degree Audit on file in the Graduate Office, b) completed all deficiencies, c) a minimum G.P.A. of 3.0 in graduate course work at Illinois State, and d) a copy of the thesis proposal approval form on file in the Graduate School if choosing a thesis option.
Master’s Comprehensive Examination
Approved 4/14/88; edited 2/17/15; edited 9/19/17; edited 4/24/18
For the comprehensive examination option, a comprehensive examination must be taken by each student before receiving the master’s degree. The content, process, scheduling, administration, and evaluation of the examination (oral, written, performance, or otherwise) are to be determined by each department and school. To apply for comprehensive examinations a student must:
be in good standing in a program,
have a Degree Audit on file in the department or school,
not be on academic probation, and
have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 at the time of the examination.
The following procedures apply to the comprehensive exam:
A student who fails the examination must wait until the next academic term before repeating the entire examination unless there are reasons that make an exception advisable. Exceptions must be requested from the Graduate School in writing by the student and advisor/chair/director.
Students who have twice failed the examination are not to repeat the exam unless they have completed further study as prescribed by the department chair or school director.
Comprehensive examinations may not be administered more than three times to individual students.
Department chairs and school directors are to notify students, by letter, of examination results within thirty days from the examination date.
A copy of this letter is to be sent to the Graduate School. (If it is a student’s second failure, recommendations for further study and appropriate warning of the situation are to be included in the letter.)
The Graduate School must receive the results from the department or school no fewer than 10 working days before the date of graduation.
After the first and second failure of comprehensive examination, the student can petition the department/school to repeat the comprehensive examination.
At the point of the third failure of comprehensive examination, the department/school will recommend to the Graduate School that the student be dismissed from the degree program.
Master’s Thesis Option
Approved 12/11/86
The student electing the thesis option must register for a minimum of four and a maximum of six hours of 499, Master's Thesis. Any student using the services of the academic faculty, staff, or the facilities of the University must be registered for the semester or term during which the services are rendered or the facilities are used including the thesis proposal or defense. Also, to register for 499 the student must be working on the subject under the direction of the advisor or thesis chairperson. No grade will be given for the course but credit (CR) will be entered on the student’s record after the final thesis is uploaded to ProQuest and finalized by the Graduate School. No credit for 499 may be given to a student who does not complete a thesis.
Master’s Thesis Committee
Approved 12/11/86; Revised 4/22/04; edited 4/26/23
A thesis is written under the direction of a thesis committee appointed in a manner specified by the department or school. All thesis committees require a minimum of two people, a chair from the student’s department/school and at least one other committee member. In all cases the chair must have full graduate faculty status. The majority of the committee, which includes the chair, should have full graduate faculty status. Inquire with your department/school for any additional requirements. An associate member may co-chair a thesis with a full member. Proposed committee members who are not members of the Illinois State University Graduate Faculty must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies. See the “Graduate Committee Information” section on the “Proposal Approval Form” to indicate the faculty who need approval to serve on the committee. A student must be admitted to a degree program in the Graduate School before a thesis committee can be appointed.
Thesis Proposal
Approved 2/18/99, updated 2/18/99
The Thesis Proposal, including the title, scope, and design, must be approved by the student's thesis committee at the proposal hearing. The Thesis Proposal Approval Form should be completed after the successful proposal hearing and submitted and approved by the Graduate School before a student is admitted to candidacy to embark on thesis research. Institutional policy also requires that all research proposals involving human subjects be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Research proposals involving animals must be reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Research proposals involving biohazards must be reviewed by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC).
In special situations, and only with the approval of the thesis committee, the department chair or school director or designee, and the Graduate School, students may collaborate on some aspects of the work contributing to their theses. However, each thesis submitted to the Graduate School for approval must be a unique product with the degree candidate as the sole author and with due acknowledgment of the contribution of collaborators. The individual student must demonstrate to her or his committee satisfactory command of all aspects of the work presented.
Thesis Acceptance
Approved 3/23/95, edited 2/5/08; 2/17/15
A complete draft of the thesis must be uploaded to ProQuest before the “Right to Defend” will be issued to the student. View complete details on the completion of the thesis.
Continuous Thesis Registration
Approved 11/14/96; edited 1/2017; edited 4/26/23
After the Thesis Proposal approval form has been accepted in the Graduate School and a student has completed the courses on the approved degree audit and registered for four to six hours of 499 Master's Thesis, the student is required to maintain continuous registration until the submission of all final deposit materials to the Graduate School. The requirement for continuous registration may be fulfilled by maintaining registration of 1 hour of 499 each semester through the semester of degree completion. Students registering for less than 9 credit hours in fall or spring, or less than 6 credit hours in summer, will not have the insurance fee automatically assessed. See the Health Insurance website 
for further information. The requirement for continuous registration does not apply during a summer term unless the student is proposing, defending, or graduating in that term. Registration for 499 may be in absentia. If circumstances prohibit continuous registration, a student must request a leave of absence. Any student interrupting registration without obtaining a leave of absence, upon re-enrollment and/or reinstatement, must pay tuition and fees for one credit hour of 499, at the current tuition and fee rates, for each of the delinquent semesters. Any student requesting reinstatement in a degree program after a lapse of one calendar year must complete an application for readmission to the program. Continuous registration for an upcoming term may be waived if all materials are submitted to the Graduate School by the Friday before the next semester starts. Consult with the Graduate School for more information.
Full-Time Equivalency
Approved 1/27/21
If a student has completed the maximum requirement of thesis hours for the program, but more time is needed, a student may register for a 1 credit of thesis for up to two (2) semesters.  This 1 credit course will be counted at a level equivalent to full-time study for the purposes of loan deferment, continued use of university student services, and graduate assistant full-time enrollment eligibility requirements.  An approved PERS 938 (Reduced Course Load Request) is still required for graduate assistants enrolled in this option.
If more time is needed beyond the first two (2) semesters, a formal request for an extension can be made to the graduate school by the thesis advisor. Extensions may be approved for a maximum of two (2) additional semesters only if a clear plan for completion has been submitted and only if the student is working at a full-time equivalency on thesis work.  Graduate students who are using this extension cannot hold a graduate assistantship.  If the extension is approved, the full-time equivalency could be used for loan deferment or continued use of student services ONLY. 
An extension request must address the following:
An explanation of why the extension is necessary;
If the extension is being requested for one or two semesters;
Explanation of how the student is working at a full-time equivalency on thesis work;
A timeline for completion in the requested time-frame; and
Approval of the thesis advisor, the graduate coordinator, and the Graduate School.
Use of the 1 credit thesis option (or extended period) may also affect the cost of attendance if a student is applying for federal and state financial aid.  Students should consult the Financial Aid department to determine how use of the option will impact the student’s eligibility for federal and state financial aid.

Two Simultaneous Master's Degrees
Approved 11/6/86, revised 9/19/17
A maximum of 12 hours of course work is allowable to count simultaneously toward two (2) master's degrees provided certain other stipulations are met. These stipulations are as follows:
that the student must be enrolled in the second master's program at least one semester prior to the completion of the first degree,
that all requirements for both degree programs be met within the six year time limit,
that a particular thesis may not be used to meet the degree requirements for more than one degree, and
that not more than three hours of the 12 hours allowed to count toward the second degree be generated by independent study, practicum, or workshop credit.
Two Simultaneous Sequences
Approved 3/22/01
Two sequences offered within the same degree program may be recognized on a student’s transcript if the student is enrolled in both sequences simultaneously as part of the requirements for completing the degree program. A common core of degree requirements and common sequence requirements may be shared across both sequences subject to the following limitations:
Students must complete the requirements for both sequences before completing the degree requirements.
The requirements for the two sequences and the degree program must be completed within a six year time limit from the time of admission to the degree program.
No more than nine hours of independent study (400), workshop (493), or professional practice (498) can be shared for both sequences and the degree program.
Thesis hours may be shared by both sequences.
Students who have been awarded a graduate degree are not eligible to pursue a second sequence within the same degree program under these provisions.

Some majors complete other types of degrees that do not include additional graduation requirements. For example, the Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S. in Ed.) or the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.). 
General Education Requirements
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
The first way is to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program (see below for details).
The second way is to complete the Illinois Transferable General Education Core Curriculum available through the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) (see below for details).
The third way is to complete a baccalaureate-oriented Associates Degree (A.A. or A.S.) from a regionally accredited post-secondary institution. For those transferring from an Illinois college or university, the A.S. degree must include the complete IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) or the student must complete the GECC to fulfill Illinois State’s General Education requirement.
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours). Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses. Depending on their major, students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major.

COM 110 Communication as Critical Inquiry (3 credit hours) - required for all students
ENG 101 or ENG 101A10 Composition as Critical Inquiry (3 credit hours) - required for all students

Major in Integrated Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Master of Professional Accountancy (M.P.A.)
The integrated B.S./M.P.A. Degrees program is primarily oriented toward preparation for professional careers in accounting. Two sequences are offered: (1) Accountancy and Information Systems, and (2) Professional Accountancy. Both sequences permit graduates of the B.S. and M.P.A. degrees to meet minimum education requirements to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination in Illinois.
The 150-hour B.S. (min. 120 hours) and M.P.A. (min. 30 hours of graduate level coursework) integrated program is designed for students wishing to complete both degrees at Illinois State University. The B.S. degree is awarded after completion of the undergraduate degree requirements and the M.P.A. degree is awarded after completion of the graduate degree requirements. The program is not designed to admit students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree.
Students must successfully apply for continuance in the B.S./M.P.A. program in their junior year. Graduate admission would take place after the student has completed approximately 90 hours. Students will be admitted who meet graduate entrance requirements, which include satisfactory performance on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), their previous academic performance, and other evidence of their ability to successfully complete the program. Admission timing is very important to successfully complete the program so students should regularly consult with their Accounting undergraduate or graduate advisor.
Courses completed in the Department of Accounting at this University with grades below C will not count toward the graduation requirements of the Integrated BS/MPA Major, but all grades of D, F, and WX in Accounting courses at this University will be included in computing the cumulative GPA.

Requirements
Transfer Student Admission Requirements
Illinois State University is a leading destination for transfer students in Illinois. With 30 percent of our students transferring from other colleges and universities, Illinois State is known for being a transfer-friendly institution.
Many programs have required and recommended courses and minimum GPA requirements, in addition to the University Requirements listed below.
Transferring Credit
Transfer Admission Guide
Majors
Due to space limitations and the competitiveness of the applicant pool, it may not be possible to offer admission to all qualified applicants. Highest admission priority will be granted to transfer students with the strongest academic records. Earning an associate's degree does not guarantee admission.
Transfer students with a minimum 2.4 GPA may be admitted to the University as undeclared if program prerequisites were not met or if space is not available in the preferred major. Students with 75 or more semester hours completed will not be admitted as undeclared.
University Requirements
What Admissions considers:
Official college transcript from each college or university attended (cumulative college GPA)
Prerequisite college coursework, for some academic programs
Good academic standing at the last college attended
Optional personal statement
Other considerations:
If you are a transfer student with fewer than 24 semester hours at the time you apply, you will also need:
High school transcript (cumulative GPA, grade trends, and rigor of courses completed)
Official SAT or ACT scores sent from the testing agency (optional)
GED scores (if non-high school graduate)
Test-takers must score a minimum of 150 on each part of the GED
If all four sections were completed prior to December 31, 2013:
Minimum score of 410 on each of the five tests
Average battery score of 450
Please note: Remedial coursework will not be taken into consideration when calculating the admission GPA or the number of semester hours earned at the time of application.
General Coursework Recommendations
We encourage all transfer students to complete the course equivalents of the following courses before they enroll at Illinois State:
Introductory-level composition (ENG 101)
Intermediate-level composition (ENG 145)
Introductory-level speech (COM 110)
An Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) approved math course (non-remedial, transferable math)
The Associate of Science degree from an Illinois public community college does not require the following courses: one humanities/fine art and one social and behavioral science. If you would like your Associate of Science degree to complete your general education requirements, we recommend completing these two courses at the community college before you transfer. However, these two courses can also be completed while attending Illinois State.
The Associate of Arts degree will fulfill general education requirements automatically.
Many programs have required and recommended courses and minimum GPA requirements, in addition to the University requirements. Please review the program requirements for your intended major before you apply.
Foreign Language Graduation Requirements
It is helpful for transfer students who wish to pursue a major in the College of Arts and Sciences or any Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree to complete foreign language graduation requirements prior to attending Illinois State.
The College of Arts and Sciences requirement may be met by:
Three years of one language in high school, OR
Completion of the second semester (LAN 112) or higher of a college-level foreign language (including American Sign Language) with a grade of C or better.
B.A. candidates must successfully complete three semesters (through LAN 115) OR pass a course proficiency test. These are required for graduation, not admission.
Admitted Transfer Student Profile
Middle 50% ranges for 2021
2.93-3.67 GPA
 Personal Statement
All applicants are welcome to submit a personal statement for review, though it is not required to complete your application. This statement may be considered along with other application materials to determine eligibility for admission. If you opt not to submit a statement and further review is needed to make an admission decision, we will request a personal statement from you at that time.
If you would like to submit a personal statement, your submission should be approximately 500 words in length and address the contributions you are prepared to make to our community, both academically and otherwise. Specifically, your statement should:
Identify any circumstances that affected your academic performance, if applicable
Make clear your commitment to academic success in college, acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses and your plans to utilize available resources
Articulate your readiness to engage productively in our campus community outside the classroom

Complaint Resolution
Complaint Resolution - Illinois State University
Federal regulations require institutions of higher education to publish contact information for use by students and other parties in filing concerns or complaints. Contacts for concerns or complaints regarding programs and services at Illinois State University are provided below. Links in this document are active; if accessing this document online, click the link to access the linked information. URLs for all links are listed at the end of this document.
Resolving Complaints on the Department/School, College, or Unit Level
The recommended first step in resolving concerns or complaints is to contact the instructor, department or school, college, or student affairs unit at the University responsible for the course, program, or service that is the source of concern or complaint. These are described below by type of concern or complaint.
Academic Concerns
The Code of Student Conduct sets forth policies regarding appropriate academic conduct and describes processes followed when violations of the code are alleged, including, but not limited to, violations of Academic Integrity policies that prohibit plagiarism and other acts of academic dishonesty. Questions regarding the Code of Student Conduct and its enforcement may be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office..
Students are encouraged to contact their instructor first if seeking assistance with a concern regarding a course or academic program, including, but not limited to, an assignment or course grade or the oral English proficiency of an instructor. If the instructor is unable to address the concern, the student may seek assistance from the chairperson or director of the academic department or school through which the course or program is offered. Concerns or complaints not resolved by the department chairperson or school director may be addressed to the dean of the college in which that department or school is administratively located. For a current list of department chairpersons, schools directors, and college deans, see the About page of the Office of the Provost website.
For policies and procedures regarding final course grade challenges, see Final Course Grade Challenge Policy, Final Course Grade Challenge Procedure, and Final Course Grade Challenge Form.
Students enrolled in an online or distance education course or program are encouraged to contact their instructor for academic concerns and the Technology Support Center for problems related to the technology used in the course or program. Concerns that cannot be resolved by the instructor or the Technology Support Center may be addressed to the chairperson of the department or director of the school through which the course or program is offered. Concerns or complaints not resolved by the department chairperson or schools director may be addressed to the dean of the college in which that department or school is administratively located. For a current list of department chairpersons, school directors, and college deans, see the About page of the Office of the Provost website.
Student Affairs Concerns
Concerns or complaints regarding student services, including, but not limited to, campus housing, campus dining services, student health services, student counseling services, and student recreation services, should first be addressed to the supervisor or director responsible for the service or unit. Students needing assistance identifying the appropriate individual or party to whom a concern or complaint should be addressed may contact the Dean of Students Office for guidance. Weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. questions may also be addressed to the Dean on Duty.
Harassment and Discrimination Concerns
Any concerns regarding alleged harassment or discrimination should be promptly addressed with the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access. OEOA is responsible for implementing complaint policies and procedures set forth in University Policy 1.2: Anti-Harassment and Non-Discrimination Policy and University Policy 1.2.1: AntiHarassment and Non-Discrimination Policy Complaint Procedures.
Student Access and Accommodations Concerns
Concerns or complaints regarding accommodation services for students and guests with disabilities and/or medical/mental health conditions may be directed to Student Access and Accommodation Services, a unit within the Division of Student Affairs.
Concerns Not Resolved on the Department/School, College, or Unit Level
Students unable to resolve concerns through contacts with instructors, department chairpersons, school directors, college deans, or student affairs unit may contact any of the three university administrative offices listed below. Written contacts are recommended, although complaints or concerns may also be filed verbally, either in person or via phone.

Students may also address any concern or complaint regarding any program or service of Illinois State University to the Illinois Board of Higher Education, the state agency responsible for oversight of colleges and universities in Illinois, or to the Higher Learning Commission, the regional entity that accredits Illinois State University. Please note that the staff of either agency may refer any person communicating a concern or complaint not yet communicated to the appropriate unit at Illinois State University back to Illinois State University.
Students enrolled in a distance education program of Illinois State University but residing in a state other than Illinois may also contact the agency in their state responsible for oversight of colleges and universities. For a list of those contacts, consult the NC-SARA website (use the States drop down menu in the navigation bar in the page header).

Honors Program Requirements
Honors Seminar: All students admitted to the Honors Program will take HON 102A17:  Honors Mindset Seminar in their first semester. Successful completion of HON 102A17 (defined as earning a “B” or better) is required to continue in the Honors Program.
Grade Point Average: Honors students are required to maintain a 3.3 cumulative GPA. Students whose cumulative GPA falls between 3.00 and 3.29 will be placed on Honors Probation, which allows them the opportunity to raise their GPA while enjoying the benefits of the Honors Program. Students on Honors Probation have up to two semesters to raise their cumulative GPA to 3.30 or higher. While on probation, students must achieve at least a 3.30 semester GPA. Students who fail to meet these requirements or whose cumulative GPA falls below 3.00 will be academically ineligible to continue in the Honors Program.
Honors Participation: Honors students are required to complete one Honors Learning Experience each semester. Part-time students (enrolled in less than 12 credit hours) are required to complete one Honors Learning Experience for every 12 credit hours completed.
Honors experiences that are credit-generating may not be taken pass/no pass and must result in a grade of "C" or better.
Students who complete multiple Honors Learning Experiences in one semester may "bank" one experience to use in a future semester.
Only one Honors Learning Experience can be "in the bank" at a time.
Honors Learning Experiences are not required in the summer; however, a summer Honors Learning Experience can be banked if the bank is "empty" or can fulfill the participation requirement for the following fall semester.
A variety of types of Honors Learning Experiences is encouraged.
When students are enrolled in the following experiences, they are not required to complete an Honors Learning Experience.
Study abroad
Student teaching (registered for STT 399)
Fall semester of Professional Development School Internship
Field-based semesters for Special Education majors (not practicum)
Full-time internships (12 hours of credit)
Full-time clinical rotations (Medical Lab Science majors)
Honors Suspension: 
Students who do not complete an Honors Learning Experience and do not have one "banked" are placed on Honors Suspension for the following semester. Students lose the privilege of early registration during the Suspension semester.
In order to regain good standing, students must complete an Honors Learning Experience during the Suspension semester. Students do not have to make up the missed experience.
There is only one Suspension semester; if a student fails to complete an experience in a future semester, s/he will be ineligible to continue in the Honors Program.
Honors Program Graduation Designations
Honors Program Scholar: To achieve this designation, students must earn a minimum 3.30 cumulative GPA at the time of graduation; participate in the Honors Program a minimum of 3 semesters; successfully complete a minimum of three Honors Learning Experiences; and continue to complete an Honors Learning Experience each semester in the Honors Program through graduation. “Honors Program Scholar” is indicated on the transcript and in the Commencement Booklet.

Visiting and Non-Degree Seeking Students
Home
Admissions
Visiting Students
Overview
A visiting student is one who does not wish to seek a degree at Illinois State University. This is an "unclassified" status in which the student is not in a degree program.
Typically these are students who are taking classes at Illinois State to transfer them to another institution or taking dual enrollment classes as a high school student. Alternatively, a visiting student may be establishing a GPA at Illinois State in hopes of being admitted to a degree program at a later time.
How to Apply
Students who are in good academic standing at their current college or university are eligible to be visiting students. If the course you wish to take has prerequisites, you must prove that you meet them by submitting an official transcript.
Visiting students may want to determine whether a course will be available prior to applying for admission. Contact the Registrar Service Center at (309) 438-2188 for assistance.
Students who have a bachelor degree must apply as a Visiting Graduate Student.
Start Application
Application Deadlines
Unclassified Status
If you attend Illinois State as a visiting student, you will be considered unclassified, which is different than being admitted to a degree program at the University. Courses you take as an unclassified student count toward your grade point average at Illinois State; however, there is no guarantee the courses you take as an unclassified student will count toward your degree should you be admitted into a degree program in the future.
Visiting students are not eligible for financial aid.
Class Registration
Some courses at Illinois State are only available to students in that major, so we cannot guarantee you will be able to take any course you wish. You can search course offerings through  Course Finder, and we will email you when course registration is available. If you need help registering for undergraduate classes, contact our academic advisors at Advising@IllinoisState.edu or (309) 438-7604. Graduate students can contact the Graduate School at GraduateSchool@IllinoisState.edu or (309) 438-2583..
Transferring Courses
If you wish to transfer the courses you take at Illinois State to another institution, we highly recommend that you consult with your academic advisor at your current institution about course transferability before you sign up for the course. Our Registrar Service Center can provide you or your institution with an official transcript.
Graduate Students
Taking Classes
Only students admitted to Illinois State as a degree student or a visiting student may take graduate classes. You should check to see whether or not the classes you want to take are available to you before submitting a visiting application. Some departments do not permit visiting student enrollment and others, because of limited staffing or physical constraints, restrict access to certain courses to their degree students. Visiting students will need to obtain a course permission/override to be eligible to register for any course at the University.
It is also recommended that you reach out to the Graduate Coordinator overseeing the graduate course you wish to complete.
Using Credits Towards a Degree
Visiting students who later decide to pursue a degree at Illinois State may petition that coursework taken as a visitor be accepted in meeting program requirements. The petition must be recommended by the program and granted by the Graduate School. Normally no more than 12 credit hours of visiting enrollment will be approved toward a degree but, under special circumstances, up to one-half of visiting credit hours may be applied. There is no guarantee or expectation that any coursework taken as a visitor will be accepted toward program degree requirements. All graduate courses taken as a visiting student will be computed into the graduate grade point average.
Connect With Your Program
If you plan to seek a graduate degree, be sure to discuss the pros and cons of visiting enrollment with the graduate coordinator of the program to which you plan to apply.
Visiting graduate students are not degree students and are, therefore, not typically eligible for most forms of financial aid.

Graduation Requirements
These are general requirements for all students. Students may apply for and receive two bachelor's degrees at the same time. Refer to the Academic Policies and Practices section of the catalog for details.
120 minimum total credit hours
A minimum of 40 of the 120 total hours must be senior college hours (200-300 level courses)
AMALI requirement (certain courses in General Education and/or major may fulfill the AMALI requirement)
IDEAS (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Access in U.S. Society) requirement (certain courses in General Education and/or major may fulfill the IDEAS requirement)
Students completing a Bachelor of Science degree must complete a B.S. - Science, Math, & Technology degree requirement (beyond the General Education requirements) 
Students completing a Bachelor of Arts degree must complete a B.A. - world language degree requirement: LAN/FRE/GER/SPA/ITA/JPN/POR 115 (or equivalent) 
Some majors complete other types of degrees that do not include additional graduation requirements. For example, the Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S. in Ed.) or the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.). 
General Education Requirements
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
The first way is to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program (see below for details).
The second way is to complete the Illinois Transferable General Education Core Curriculum available through the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) (see below for details).
The third way is to complete a baccalaureate-oriented Associates Degree (A.A. or A.S.) from a regionally accredited post-secondary institution. For those transferring from an Illinois college or university, the A.S. degree must include the complete IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) or the student must complete the GECC to fulfill Illinois State’s General Education requirement.
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours). Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses. Depending on their major, students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major.

The department strongly recommends students take at least 6 credit hours of advanced electives in the major. 
A chemistry or math course in the major may not be attempted more than twice during a student’s undergraduate career. An exception may be requested only once for only one course during a student's undergraduate career if the GPA in the major plan is 2.00 or higher, and the overall GPA is 2.00 or higher. A student who does not complete the course with a grade of C or better on the third attempt will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Any student who would need an additional third enrollment to enroll in any other required chemistry or math course in the major will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Each attempt in which the student receives a grade, including a grade of WX, is counted as an attempt.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct. The University also reserves the rights to establish additional requirements with respect to specific University venues.
In general, the University will not interfere with events, meetings, assemblies, rallies, demonstrations, vigils, or protests in public areas of University facilities and spaces unless participants engage in one or more of the following behaviors:
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent (a) the orderly conduct of a function or activity, including, but not limited to, classes and other instructional activities; research; study; lectures; presentations; performances; meetings; interviews; administrative business; ceremonies; or other public events; or (b) access to any room or space in which such functions or activities are being held. 
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent access to particular spaces where educational, health, or financial records are stored or located. 
Hold assemblies, demonstrations, protests, rallies, or vigils in:
Private offices or in private meetings.
Laboratories and associated facilities;
Computer centers;
Milner Library;
Indoor areas designed for study and designated as quiet spaces or facilities that normally contain valuable or sensitive materials, collections, or records protected by law or by an existing university procedure/policy;
Health care clinics, and other health care facilities;
Communication systems facilities, utility facilities, or other facilities conducting services vital to the continued functioning of the University.
Rooms in reasonable proximity to any of the above University facilities and spaces that would cause a noise disruption or otherwise interfere with University operations.
Injure persons, damage or destroy property, or threaten to cause such injury or damage.
Create safety hazards or jeopardize the safety and security of participants or others.
Occupy without authorization a building when it is normally closed or when individuals are not otherwise authorized to be there.
Construct structures on University grounds without prior written authorization from the Director of Facilities Management (or designee).
Violate an applicable federal or state law, local government ordinance, or University policy or procedure.
Continue to engage in behaviors prohibited in this section after a University official or University Police has declared that the conduct violates University policies or an applicable law and has instructed the participants to modify or

Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) Program
Degree Offered: M.F.A.
The Master of Fine Arts in Art is a 60-hour program that emphasizes both theory and practice in the production, history, and teaching of the visual arts. Candidates will be expected to demonstrate artistic proficiency in at least one of the following disciplines: painting and drawing, sculpture and expanded media, printmaking, video, ceramics, photography, or glass. Candidates will also be expected to demonstrate proficiency in written and oral communication.
Students may also engage in an internship or apprenticeship. This may take the form of a guided teaching experience or work in a professional area related to the student's area of interest. The exact nature of this experience will be worked out through counseling between the major advisor and the student and will be tailored to best suit the needs of each student. This project will be subject to approval of the student's graduate committee and the School Director.
It should be understood that the accumulation of 60 semester credit hours is not the primary criterion in evaluating a student’s final achievement. The primary criterion in the evaluation of the MFA degree will be a Thesis Exhibition which demonstrates intellectual maturity and artistic proficiency in the student’s major studio area. In addition to the Thesis Exhibition, the MFA degree requires the completion of a Thesis Supportive Statement, which is a critical essay that focuses on the student’s studio work, its development, and its cultural and historical references. The M.F.A. Candidate will be required to pass an oral defense.
This 60-hour degree program requires:
36 semester hours must be taken in the Wonsook Kim School of Art, of these at least 24 must be at the 400 level
24 semester hours must be in the student's major studio area, of these at least 18 must be at the 400 level
Of the total required 60 hours, 12 semester hours must be taken in art history, or nine hours may be taken in art history with three hours in related areas such as aesthetics, philosophy, or anthropology, or ART 494 MFA Seminar
3 hours: ART 494 MFA Seminar. Taking the MFA Seminar to satisfy Art History requirements does not substitute for this requirement (494 is included within the 36 hours)
6 hours: ART 496 M.F.A. Exhibition and Supportive Statement. This will involve a comprehensive exhibition of studio work, an exhibition-related written project, and a comprehensive oral examination. A candidacy review must take place before a student can enroll in ART 496 or schedule the MFA exhibition and must include approval of proposal for the supportive statement. (496 is included within the 36 hours.)
The School reserves the right to keep images of original work produced by graduate students for educational and archival purposes.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

Class Attendance
The attendance regulation of the University is based on two principles. First, students are expected to attend class regularly; and second, students are primarily responsible to the instructor in matters pertaining to class attendance. Every student will be held responsible for class attendance and successful completion of academic work. Attendance regulations are intended to encourage student maturity and are based on the assumption that academic success is the student’s primary goal in college.
Equitable Treatment Of Students Participating In University Sponsored Activities
Student Bereavement Policy
Student Absences Due to Service as a Volunteer Emergency Worker
Absence of Student Due to Religious Beliefs
 - Any student in an institution of higher learning, other than a religious or denominational institution of higher learning, who is unable, because of his or her religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examination, study, or work requirement and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up the examination, study, or work requirement that he or she may have missed because of such absence on a particular day; provided that the student notifies the faculty member or instructor well in advance of any anticipated absence or a pending conflict between a scheduled class and the religious observance and provided that the make-up examination, study, or work does not create an unreasonable burden upon the institution. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the student such an opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of his or her availing himself or herself of the provisions of this Section.  For more information please see the ISU Policy 1.6 Religious Accommodation Policy available at: 
https://policy.illinoisstate.edu/conduct/1-1-6.shtml
. 
Military Service - In accordance with state laws and regulations (330 ILCS 60/5.2), a service member enrolled in an institution of higher learning who is unable, because of his or her military service, to attend classes on a particular day or days has the right to be excused and to reschedule a course examination administered on such day or days. The faculty and administrative officials shall make available to the service member an opportunity to make up any examination he or she has missed because of his or her military service. 
Extended Student Absences - As a service to students, the Dean of Students Office can provide notification to instructors when students have been/will be absent from class(es) for three or more consecutive days and are unable to notify their instructors. Students are not required to report absences to the Dean of Students Office; the office serves as a resource to help students reach instructors. The student is responsible for providing verification of the absence to instructors, if requested. Only instructors have the authority to excuse students from class(es) or coursework. 
Student Leave of Absence Policy 2.1.5 - Students may request a leave of absence for up to six (6) consecutive terms (Fall, Spring, Summer).
Class Registration - Assistance with the class registration process may be obtained by contacting the Registrar Service Center at Registrar@IllinoisState.edu, (309) 438-2188, or in-person in Moulton Hall Room 107. Students at Illinois State University are responsible for following registration procedures to assure valid registration for classes. A student may not attend a class for which they are not properly registered. A correct registration is each student's responsibility. The University reserves the right to void the registration of any student who becomes ineligible for enrollment. 
Classroom Disruption - Policy 4.1.17
College of Arts and Sciences foreign language graduate requirement
College Level Examination (CLEP) (Undergraduate Proficiency Examination) 
Campus Conduct
Class Standing - Students in a bachelor’s degree program are classified as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A student must have completed 30 semester hours to be classified as a sophomore, 60 hours to be classified as a junior, and 90 hours to be classified as a senior. Students not working toward a degree at Illinois State are listed as non-degree-seeking students.
Code of Student Conduct - The Code of Student Conduct details the rules and regulations for students and student organizations.
Course Load (Academic Load)  - A full-time undergraduate student carries between 12 and 17 hours. Courses taken on an audit (AU) basis do not count toward full-time student status. For enrollment verification purposes, 12 hours is considered full-time for undergraduate students. A student wishing to carry more than 17 hours in a semester (12 hours in summer) may seek permission to do so their academic advisor. The granting of this permission will depend on the student’s scholastic record. A freshman may not carry over 17 hours during their first semester. A student considering enrolling in any classes, including extension or correspondence, at another college or university with concurrent registration at Illinois State University should consult with their advisor.
Course Information - Numbering, types, terms used in course descriptions 
Course Repetition(s) - If a student completes a course, or drops a course after the tenth day of classes receiving a grade of WX, the student may repeat that course once.  Students seeking a third enrollment must obtain permission from the academic advisor who will submit a Registration Clearance Permit request to the Registrar Service Center to allow the student to register in the course. When a course has been repeated at Illinois State University, the most recent grade (A, B, C, D, F) that the student earns will replace the previous grade in the cumulative GPA calculation. A grade of WX, AU, I, CR, CT, NC, P, NP will not replace the grade, nor the hours earned in the prior attempt. The previous grade(s) will not be removed from the student’s transcript, and the credit hours from only the last attempt can be used toward meeting minimum hourly requirements.When an articulated course has been repeated at another college or university, that grade will not replace the previous grade earned at ISU nor can it be used to improve the cumulative or major grade point average. However, the transfer credit may be used to satisfy a prerequisite, major, minor, or other requirement at Illinois State University.Students repeating a course to improve their GPA should be aware that many professional and graduate schools recalculate GPAs to include all courses attempted. Graduate students should be aware that this regulation does not apply to general courses (see Limitation of Credit for General Courses section in the Graduate Catalog). Courses that allow multiple enrollments have a separate grade recorded for each enrollment and each grade (A, B, C, D, or F) is counted toward the student's GPA. Previous grades are not replaced or removed from the student’s record until the maximum allowable enrollments or credit hours for the course has been exceeded.An Illinois State student considering repeating or enrolling in any classes, including extension or correspondence, at another college or university while enrolled at or pursuing a degree from Illinois State University should consult with their advisor.

Second Bachelor’s Degree - Policy 2.1.9 Baccalaureate Degree Programs A student who has already received one bachelor’s degree from Illinois State University or from another regionally accredited college or university may receive a second bachelor’s degree at Illinois State University upon completion of degree requirements. Students must meet the admission requirements for the major selected and meet appropriate deadlines. Second bachelor degree seeking students are required to fulfill degree requirements as listed in the catalog at the time of admission to the second bachelor degree program. The program of studies completed for the second degree must include at least 32 semester hours of coursework taken after the granting of the first degree, of which 30 hours must be taken in residence at Illinois State. At least 24 of the 32 hours completed toward the second degree must be at senior college-level (courses numbered 200 and above).  
A student may apply for and receive two bachelor degrees in the same term. To receive two degrees simultaneously, completion of a minimum of 150 credit hours is required. The degrees may be the same (e.g., two B.A. degrees) or different (e.g., a B.A. and a B.S.). The majors may be the same as long as two different sequences are completed. All requirements for both degrees, both majors and sequences, and all general graduation requirements must be met.
Senior College Hours - The senior college hours (courses numbered 200 or above) must total at least 40 hours. Coursework transferred from other colleges and universities is not counted as senior college credit if freshmen and sophomores are regularly permitted to enroll in such work. No credit from two year colleges may be counted as senior level.
State Seal of Biliteracy -  According to the Illinois State Board of Education, the State Seal of Biliteracy “recognizes public high school graduates who have attained a high level of proficiency in one or more languages in addition to English.” Illinois State University accepts the State Seal of Biliteracy from any state as equivalent to two semesters (8 credits) of language study (LAN 111-112) in languages offered at the University. If the seal is granted in a language not offered at Illinois State University, eight credit hours of lower division foreign language will be awarded. Students must request course credit for their seal within three academic years after graduating from high school. No credit will be awarded for the State Commendation toward Biliteracy, though students with the commendation are encouraged to determine their level through self-placement exams and/or proficiency exams (refer to the Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures (LAN) website). Students with the Seal of Biliteracy may also be eligible for higher levels of credit, which can be earned through taking a course (see self-placement exams) or a proficiency exam (refer to the LAN website).

Transferring credit - Registrar's Office processes
Transcripts Policy 2.1.23
Tuition and Fees - Tuition, fees, on-campus housing charges and dining charges are determined by action of the Board of Trustees on a yearly basis. Tuition and fees other than health insurance are assessed at a per semester hour rate. Health insurance is assessed to all students enrolled for nine or more semester hours. Upon being first enrolled in a degree program at Illinois State University, tuition rates for undergraduate students will be locked for a four-year period. Certain degree programs qualify for the locked rate to be extended beyond the four-year period. Tuition and fees are subject to change by action of the Board of Trustees and the General Assembly. For additional information, refer to the Student Accounts website.
Auditors - Students who take all courses as auditors without credit are charged at the current rate per semester hour for tuition and fees. Auditing a class does not count toward full-time student status for financial aid and other purposes. 
Changes in Schedule - A student who drops a course will be charged according to the schedule on the Student Accounts website. 
Materials Charges - Material charges listed with individual course information on the Course Finder website or at My.IllinoisState.edu in the registration system, are automatically charged to the student’s account. A student may supply his or her own materials and request the instructor, in writing, to reduce the materials charge.
Payment of Tuition and Fees - Illinois State University offers payment plans for current semester charges. Students will choose what plan works best for their needs or must pay in full by the designated date listed on the Student Accounts website to avoid being enrolled in an administrative plan. Paying in full is the only way to avoid a payment plan fee.
Insurance Fee Reduction - A student may receive a reduction of the insurance fee if the student demonstrates equal or better insurance coverage and completes the application and provides proof of other coverage each semester prior to the 15th calendar on the day of the fall and spring semesters and the 8th calendar day of the summer semester. Visit Student Insurance website for specific information.
Reduction in Charges:
Pursuant to guidelines established by the University, part or all of a student’s tuition and fees may be reduced because of the student’s death or disability, extreme hardship, or institutional error.
A student may receive a reduction of all tuition and fees if the University declares him or her ineligible for enrolled status prior to the first day of regularly scheduled class.
Visit the Housing website for information regarding changes to or cancellation of housing contracts 
Visit the Campus Dining website for information regarding changes to or cancellation of a dining plan 
Students or parents who believe that individual circumstances warrant exceptions from published policy may appeal to the Associate Vice President for Student Affairs.
Resident and Non-Resident Status - An applicant or enrolled student is classified either as a resident of Illinois, a non-resident, or a foreign student. Residency for tuition purposes is different from residency for voting, taxing purposes, undergraduate degree academic residency, or residency requirements of on-campus doctoral programs. A student must be a U.S. citizen or have been approved for U.S. Permanent Resident status in order to be considered as an Illinois resident. An individual’s residency status is based on information from the admission application. A student who is not a resident of Illinois pays an out-of-state differential charge per credit hour. All other fees are the same for non-residents. A student under 18 years of age is considered a non-resident if the student’s parents are not legal residents of Illinois. A student over 18 years of age is considered a non-resident if the student is not a legal resident of Illinois. A student who begins as a non-resident may later qualify for resident status. Additionally, select students receive an alternate rate of tuition of 1.0 times the current in-state rate, including: students admitted from Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin; veterans and students utilizing VA education benefit, students who meet the eligibility requirements (as set for the specific fall term in question) for our principal scholarship programs, namely the Presidential, University, Redbird, Transfer Student Scholarship, or Phi Theta Kappa Scholarship; students who are identified by a unit (Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts, Forensics, Gamma Phi Circus) through their selective processes (audition, portfolio, etc.) based upon a specific talent. Guidelines for qualifying and special circumstances may be found on the University Registrar’s website. Personnel within the Office of the University Registrar are responsible for determining residency. 
Summer Session Tuition and Fees - The summer session tuition and fees are assessed at a per semester hour rate. Students enrolled for six or more semester hours will be charged the current rate for health insurance.
Withdrawal and Reduction of Tuition and Fees - If a student drops a course or withdraws from Illinois State University, charges for tuition, mandatory fees, and outreach fees will be adjusted based on the date of the course drop or withdrawal. A registered student who officially withdraws from the University may receive a reduction of tuition and fees according to the schedule on the Student Accounts website. The University may designate an abbreviated withdrawal policy for summer session, special courses, and short courses.All notifications of withdrawal from the University must be in person with photo ID to the Registrar Service Center, 107 Moulton Hall, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, or in writing and addressed to Office of the University Registrar, Illinois State University, Campus Box 2202, Normal, IL 61790-2202, faxed to (309) 438-8652, or emailed from the student’s Illinois State University email account to Registrar@IllinoisState.edu.
Undergraduate Teaching Assistantships (UTA) and Undergraduate Research Assistantships (URA)
Undergraduate Teaching Assistantships are available in nearly all departments of the University to juniors and seniors who have demonstrated excellence in a particular discipline and high overall  scholastic achievement.  The purpose of the program is to assist the faculty in the improvement of instruction and to provide UTAs with a valuable learning opportunity.
Undergraduate Research Assistantships (URA) are available in selected departments for students who have demonstrated excellence in a particular discipline with significant potential in research. The purpose of the program is to work closely with faculty members and to provide students valuable opportunities for research.
The responsibilities and nature of the UTA and URA assignments are determined by the departments and colleges. Some departments provide the opportunity for credit to be earned by the UTA under a General Offerings course (291 Seminar: Undergraduate Teaching Assistants). Three hours is the maximum amount of this credit that may be allowed for graduation. Tuition and fees are assessed in the usual manner for all credit earned in the UTA and URA experiences. Application forms are available in the departmental and college offices.

All master's degree programs require a minimum of 50 percent of the non-thesis credit hours applied to the degree to be 400-level courses or above.
Academic Advisors
An advisory committee will be assigned upon admission. The School Director, in consultation with the student and faculty whom the Director deems appropriate, will select the candidate's portfolio committee. The portfolio committee chair must come from the student's studio area.
Transfer Credit
A student who does not have an earned master's degree usually may present no more than six semester hours of credit from another college or university for use in meeting the requirements of the M.F.A. degree. However, a student may present all earned hours from an M.A./M.S. program in Theatre Studies at Illinois State University for use in meeting these requirements.
The total hours required for a student with an earned master's degree will be based on an evaluation of the student's portfolio and academic record. However, the final determination will not be made until the student has completed a minimum of six semester hours in his/her major area of emphasis. The student's M.F.A. committee will supervise all evaluations. Refer to M.F.A. Transfer Credit in the Fields of Study and Degrees Granted section.
A minimum of 32 hours must be taken at Illinois State University
Residency Requirement
A student without an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least four semesters with at least two of them being full-time, consecutive semesters. A student with an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least two full-time, consecutive semesters. Summer session may be counted toward the two consecutive semester requirement.
The M.F.A. Portfolio
Each semester of enrollment the M.F.A. candidate will enroll in THE 501, M.F.A. Portfolio, for one hour credit. The portfolio is the backbone of the Master of Fine Arts program. It is designed to ensure the regular and systematic evaluation of the student's progress. The portfolio is a collection of materials, including examples of the student's work where appropriate, reviews, evaluations and other artifacts, which may record or characterize the student's experience in the program. The portfolio also contains the student's responses to evaluations as well as statements from the Portfolio Committee which provide direction for the student's future work in the program.
The student must have a portfolio evaluation for each full semester he or she is in the program. The written results of that evaluation are included in the portfolio. The portfolio provides a cumulative record of the student's progress which is carried over from semester to semester.
Finally, the portfolio, with its record of the student's activities in the program, provides the major objective basis for awarding the degree. Although the student may engage in major creative projects during his or her program, the portfolio stands in lieu of the traditional thesis or creative thesis project which is the culminating experience in many programs.
Qualifying/Comprehensive Examination
A qualifying examination is required prior to the exit portfolio presentation. It may be comprehensive to the extent that it examines the candidate's knowledge of the discipline of theatre; it may include graduate work the student is presenting for the degree; and it may include demonstration of proficiency. The examination will be conducted by the student's M.F.A. Portfolio Committee. The student may request that other faculty members with whom he/she has taken course work participate in the qualifying examination.
Final Portfolio Review and Exit Interview
To be eligible for the exit portfolio presentation, the student must (1) present a grade average of B or better with not more than six (6) hours of a grade of C; (2) have completed (or will complete in the current semester) two semesters of full-time resident study; (3) have a degree audit on file with the Graduate School; (4) have passed a qualifying examination; and (5) pass a final portfolio review and exit to be conducted by his/her M.F.A. Committee. The format of this review and exit will be determined by the M.F.A. Committee, who will, when the work is deemed satisfactory, recommend the student to the appropriate studio area for graduation. At least one week before the Graduate School graduation notification deadline, the School Graduate Faculty will meet to hear the studio area's recommendations. Once the Graduate Faculty has approved the student's graduation, the student will be recommended to the Graduate School for the granting of the degree.
Students should consult with their M.F.A. Portfolio Committees and the School Graduate Advisor for details and the calendar of the final portfolio review and exit. While no student is guaranteed graduation, those whose work is deemed unsatisfactory may be presented opportunities for remediation by their Portfolio Committees.

All master's degree programs require a minimum of 50 percent of the non-thesis credit hours applied to the degree to be 400-level courses or above.
Academic Advisors
An advisory committee will be assigned upon admission. The School Director, in consultation with the student and faculty whom the Director deems appropriate, will select the candidate's portfolio committee. The portfolio committee chair must come from the student's studio area.
Transfer Credit
A student who does not have an earned master's degree usually may present no more than six semester hours of credit from another college or university for use in meeting the requirements of the M.F.A. degree. However, a student may present all earned hours from an M.A./M.S. program in Theatre Studies at Illinois State University for use in meeting these requirements.
The total hours required for a student with an earned master's degree will be based on an evaluation of the student's portfolio and academic record. However, the final determination will not be made until the student has completed a minimum of six semester hours in his/her major area of emphasis. The student's M.F.A. committee will supervise all evaluations. Refer to M.F.A. Transfer Credit in the Fields of Study and Degrees Granted section.
A minimum of 32 hours must be taken at Illinois State University
Residency Requirement
A student without an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least four semesters with at least two of them being full-time, consecutive semesters. A student with an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least two full-time, consecutive semesters. Summer session may be counted toward the two consecutive semester requirement.
The M.F.A. Portfolio
Each semester of enrollment the M.F.A. candidate will enroll in THE 501, M.F.A. Portfolio, for one hour credit. The portfolio is the backbone of the Master of Fine Arts program. It is designed to ensure the regular and systematic evaluation of the student's progress. The portfolio is a collection of materials, including examples of the student's work where appropriate, reviews, evaluations and other artifacts, which may record or characterize the student's experience in the program. The portfolio also contains the student's responses to evaluations as well as statements from the Portfolio Committee which provide direction for the student's future work in the program.
The student must have a portfolio evaluation for each full semester he or she is in the program. The written results of that evaluation are included in the portfolio. The portfolio provides a cumulative record of the student's progress which is carried over from semester to semester.
Finally, the portfolio, with its record of the student's activities in the program, provides the major objective basis for awarding the degree. Although the student may engage in major creative projects during his or her program, the portfolio stands in lieu of the traditional thesis or creative thesis project which is the culminating experience in many programs.
Qualifying/Comprehensive Examination
A qualifying examination is required prior to the exit portfolio presentation. It may be comprehensive to the extent that it examines the candidate's knowledge of the discipline of theatre; it may include graduate work the student is presenting for the degree; and it may include demonstration of proficiency. The examination will be conducted by the student's M.F.A. Portfolio Committee. The student may request that other faculty members with whom he/she has taken course work participate in the qualifying examination.
Final Portfolio Review and Exit Interview
To be eligible for the exit portfolio presentation, the student must (1) present a grade average of B or better with not more than six (6) hours of a grade of C; (2) have completed (or will complete in the current semester) two semesters of full-time resident study; (3) have a degree audit on file with the Graduate School; (4) have passed a qualifying examination; and (5) pass a final portfolio review and exit to be conducted by his/her M.F.A. Committee. The format of this review and exit will be determined by the M.F.A. Committee, who will, when the work is deemed satisfactory, recommend the student to the appropriate studio area for graduation. At least one week before the Graduate School graduation notification deadline, the School Graduate Faculty will meet to hear the studio area's recommendations. Once the Graduate Faculty has approved the student's graduation, the student will be recommended to the Graduate School for the granting of the degree.
Students should consult with their M.F.A. Portfolio Committees and the School Graduate Advisor for details and the calendar of the final portfolio review and exit. While no student is guaranteed graduation, those whose work is deemed unsatisfactory may be presented opportunities for remediation by their Portfolio Committees.

Notes
For History (B.A.) – Students are encouraged to complete a minor, but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than History or a Foreign Language, with at least three credit hours at the senior college level.
For History (B.S.) – Major requirements are the same as for the B.A. except students must complete a minor.
* It is encouraged for students to take courses approved for graduate credit. For 300-level and 400-level courses approved for graduate credit see courses listed with (GRAD) at the History Course Directory.
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in History. In addition to the HIS 497 required course, students may choose to take up to 9 hours of graduate level electives to count towards the 9 credit hours of additional senior college level History electives required for the undergraduate program. It is strongly recommended that one of these courses be HIS 496, another required course for the MA/MS degree. Refer to the Course Finder website for 400-level graduate courses and 300-level courses that are approved for graduate credit. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure graduate-level approval. For information on graduate-level history requirements, please visit the graduate academic catalog.

Admission/Retention Requirements
						Admission Requirements: Students may declare a major in the School of Social Work upon admission to the University or with permission of the School.
All Social Work majors must also be formally admitted to the BSW program. The BSW Program admission process typically occurs during the fall semester sophomore year and is a prerequisite for taking any 300-level Social Work course. Students are required to complete the formal BSW Program admissions process before their enrollment in SWK 222, SWK 223, SWK 325, SWK 326, and SWK 310.
To be accepted, students must have satisfied the following requirements:
At least 30 hours of credit with a minimum 2.50 overall GPA
Grade of C or better in all required SWK courses
12 hours required in an introductory social work course and liberal arts courses: SWK 170; PSY 110, PSY 350; SOC 106.
General Education courses must be completed prior to admission to the BSW program. Academic credit for life experience and/or previous work experience is not given, in whole or in part, in lieu of any Social Work course.
Exceptions are granted upon the recommendations of the Social Work Admission Committee and the Director or designee of the Social Work program.
Illinois State University School of Social Work completes criminal background checks for all BSW candidates and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic record and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon successfully completing and passing a national background check. The school may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to the BSW program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some field instruction placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the MSW/BSW degree. Many agencies require criminal background checks as a condition for accepting a placement in their program. It is the student’s responsibility to inquire with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to the BSW program, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the School of Social Work. Students must meet the criteria for professional and ethical behavior as set forth by the School of Social Work.
NOTE: The School of Social Work reserves the right to maintain a balanced enrollment. This may restrict the numbers of freshmen, transfer students, and internal transfers who wish to be Social Work majors.
Most Social Work courses are restricted to Social Work majors with the exception of SWK electives.
The School does not offer a minor in Social Work.
Only Social Work students may take required courses.

Minor in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. 
Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program, Queer Studies Concentration
Child Welfare Concentration
This concentration has been designed for students who wish to enhance their education and preparation as a social work major by integrating a working knowledge of child welfare practice with the undergraduate social work degree.
The School, in partnership with the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), now offers social work students an opportunity to complete two specialty Child Welfare Classes (SWK 323 and SWK 324) to become certified child welfare specialists upon completion of their social work degree. The re-designed course integrates training material from the DCFS child welfare specialist training curricula and also prepares students for a series of exams and online instruction. Students must have their degree conferred (post-graduation), and be employed by a child welfare agency to apply for and finalize their Child Welfare Employee Licensure and Child Welfare Specialist credentials.
Social Aspects of Aging Minor
Students interested in enhancing their knowledge of gerontological issues should consider completing a Minor in Social Aspects of Aging.
Retention Requirements
The School reserves the right to enforce professional standards of practice as specified in Section 6369 of the Clinical Social Work and Practice Act. These standards may be taken into consideration in decisions related to program retention. Additionally, 
to continue to progress through the program
 students must maintain a cumulative 
major
 grade point average of 2.50 and a grade of C or better in all SWK required courses. 
To proceed into SWK 394 and SWK 398A10, General Education requirements must be completed.
Credentialing Opportunities
The Baccalaureate Degree in Social Work is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. The principal educational goal is to prepare students for beginning generalist social work practice.

Additional Information
Illinois State University operates on a semester calendar, so hours taken at an institution following a quarter or other calendar will be converted to semester hours.
Transfer credit is evaluated and placed according to the course numbering system from the transfer institution.
Credit from a community college is not recognized as senior college level credit.
Transfer students begin with a new GPA because only credit hours transfer; grades are not transferable.
Illinois State University participates in the State of Illinois Reverse Transfer of Credit initiative which helps students who have enrolled at an Illinois community college to complete an associate degree. Read more about Illinois State's reverse transfer process.

By combining your study of world languages with your major, you will acquire the skills to navigate today's work environment and make yourself more marketable.
Are you ready to prepare for your future? Contact your University College advisor or the Major advisor listed below to learn how to internationalize your major.
Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders
Internationalize your major and improve your cultural competence by integrating a second major or a minor in a world language. Students will also enhance their cultural and linguistic skills by participating in a study abroad experience.

Notes
For History (B.A.) – Students are encouraged to complete a minor, but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than History or a Foreign Language, with at least three credit hours at the senior college level.
For History (B.S.) – Major requirements are the same as for the B.A. except students must complete a minor.
* It is encouraged for students to take courses approved for graduate credit. For 300-level and 400-level courses approved for graduate credit see courses listed with (GRAD) at the History Course Directory.
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in History. In addition to the HIS 497 required course, students may choose to take up to 9 hours of graduate level electives to count towards the 9 credit hours of additional senior college level History electives required for the undergraduate program. It is strongly recommended that one of these courses be HIS 496, another required course for the MA/MS degree. Refer to the Course Finder website for 400-level graduate courses and 300-level courses that are approved for graduate credit. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure graduate-level approval. For information on graduate-level history requirements, please visit the graduate academic catalog.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct.

    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

Civic Engagement and Responsibility
Overview
Illinois State’s core values are at the heart of the civic engagement and responsibility minor. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world.
The minor includes an internship class: IDS 398.02a:Community-Engaged Internship. For more information about how to apply for the internship, please refer to the 
internship application packet. The internship course is a culmination of the minor as the student engages in some aspect of service learning in the community. Contact Wendi Whitman to learn about the internship opportunity and to learn how to apply for the minor.
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Course Requirements (Catalog)
Point of Pride
The Center for Civic Engagement supports our core value of civic engagement through programs, resources, and administrative support for campus initiatives like the American Democracy Project and the Civic Engagement and Responsibility minor.
We are the first and longest standing formal academic minor in the state of Illinois focused on civic engagement. Our Minor is interdisciplinary and our graduates and current students have majors in five of the six colleges.
Why study Civic Engagement and Responsibility?
The Civic Engagement and Responsibility minor prepares you to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in your communities. This interdisciplinary minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden your learning experience and career perspectives. The minor gives you opportunities to sharpen your analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action.
How to Apply
Application Information
Minors can only be declared by current Illinois State students. Current students can use the Apply to Your Program tool on My.IllinoisState.edu.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Admission to the English major may be affected and restricted by the lack of available Department resources in times of oversubscription. Students in the major and all sequences must pass ENG 100 with a C or better in order to advance and complete the program. 
For information about admission to this program visit the 
University’s Academics website
.
The Accelerated English Education Sequence (AEES) is an Accelerated Master's Degree (AMD) program, which serves as a pathway to the Master's in English Education. This AMD is designed for undergraduate teacher education students who, when they graduate with their undergraduate degree, will pursue employment as secondary English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. Qualifying students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher may apply to the AEES once they have reached junior status. Admission is based on competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures are available on the English Education website and applications are considered on a rotating basis each fall and spring semester. Acceptance into the AEES constitutes acceptance into the MA/MS in English Education. To transfer to graduate-only status after completing the BA in English Education, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the MA/MS in English Education. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing.

Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of English participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the following minors: African Studies, African-American Studies, Children’s Studies, Civic Engagement and Responsibility, Cognitive Science, Ethnic Studies, European Studies, International Studies, Latin American and Latino/a Studies, Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies, Native American Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and also the Minor in Religious Studies in the Department of Philosophy. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs and Department of Philosophy sections.
Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing. By providing a broad work experience, students not only build their portfolios, but also enter the marketplace with valuable and current skills.
View Publishing Studies Sequence Course Requirements
Technical Writing and Rhetorics Sequence
Technical Writing and Rhetorics is a sequence in the English major. Professional technical writers take complex information and communicate it in a way that people understand. Focusing on this sequence prepares you for a career as a technical and professional writer in a variety of settings, such as corporate, nonprofit, and governmental organizations. You will develop the skills and knowledges needed to communicate specialized information effectively to a range of audiences. The sequence offers degrees in both the B.A. and the B.S.
View Technical Writing and Rhetorics Sequence Course Requirements
English Teacher Education Sequence
The English Teacher Education program (ETE) is an English Studies sequence in the Department of English (College of Arts and Sciences) at Illinois State University. Admitted teacher candidates will prepare to become effective secondary (grades 9-12) English Language Arts (ELA) teachers in diverse classrooms. Coursework in the 46-hour major develops content knowledge and discipline-specific methods by addressing how theory and research support best practices in integrated language arts skills pedagogy.
Teacher candidates develop and apply instructional delivery skills through clinical experiences conducted at University High School (Illinois State's on-campus laboratory school) and a variety of public school classrooms: rural, suburban, and urban.
Admission to the English Teacher Education Sequence is limited and is based on cohort space availability and competitiveness of the applicant.
A 3.00 GPA in the major, a 2.5 cumulative GPA, a grade of C or better in all required major courses, and adherence to all application procedures and deadlines is required for admission to Professional Studies and Student Teaching. Deadlines and information about application forms and procedures for admission to Professional Studies and Student Teaching are available from the Council for Teacher Education and on the English Department website and are strictly enforced.

Major in Sociology
Sociology majors at Illinois State explore a diverse range of topics and learn to think critically about the social world. Our distinguished faculty members are committed to helping students develop the analytical skills they need to gain a deeper understanding of the world in which we live.
Sociologists look under the surface of social life. They analyze data and develop theories in order to understand and explain social patterns, issues, and problems. Sociology not only helps us understand the roots of these issues and problems, but can also help inform policies that contribute to their solutions.
View Sociology Course Requirements
Minor in Sociology
18 total credit hours in Sociology required
Required course
SOC 106
15 credit hours of electives, 9 credit hours must be at the 200- or 300-level.

Anthropology
Degree Offered: B.A., B.S.
Major in Anthropology
Anthropology is a discipline concerned with people in their entirety: our evolution and physical variation, the remnants of our prehistoric past, the cultural and linguistic diversity of human societies past and present.
Anthropology has four subfields: archaeology, anthropological linguistics, cultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. An anthropological education begins with learning the fundamentals. This means taking courses representative of all four subfields.
Students in the Anthropology major must complete one of the following sequences.
Anthropology Sequence
View Anthropology Course Requirements
Accelerated Anthropology Sequence
View Accelerated Anthropology Course Requirements
Program Admission Requirements
The Accelerated Anthropology Sequence (AAS) is a pathway to the Master’s Program in Anthropology. Accelerated degree programs offer high-achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor’s degree and master’s degree with one additional year of study. Students accepted to the sequence will be allowed to take courses during their senior year that will count toward both the undergraduate and graduate programs in anthropology. Qualifying students must apply to the AAS in the spring semester of their junior year. Admission is based on space availability and competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures and deadlines are available on the Anthropology Program website.
Acceptance into the AAS constitutes acceptance into the Master’s Program in Anthropology and thus students will take up to 12 hours of graduate-level credits during their senior year. To transfer to graduate-only status for their second year, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the Master’s Program in Anthropology in the spring of their senior year. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing and have made good progress towards their M.A. degree during their senior year.
A maximum of 12 of the total 15 hours of elective courses may be taken for graduate credit
Some 300-level courses are offered for undergraduate or graduate credit. Students in the Accelerated Sequence who want to count a 300-level course toward their 12 hours of required graduate coursework, must enroll in the 300-level course for graduate credit at the beginning of the course in order for it to count.
To graduate in this sequence, a student must take at least one course for graduate credit during the senior year. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure approval.
Notes
The following anthropology courses may be taken by anthropology majors to fulfill General Education requirements but do not count towards electives for the major: ANT 143, ANT 176, ANT 197
All anthropology majors are encouraged to take SOC 275 (Social Statistics) as part of their undergraduate curriculum, however no Sociology courses may be counted toward the 40 hours in Anthropology required for the major
Special topics courses (ANT 306 and ANT 383) vary from semester to semester may be taken twice for credit if the content is different.
All Graduate School admission deadlines and policies apply to courses for graduate credit
Minor in Anthropology

The required international business courses provide solid exposure to the unique dynamics of international business. Area studies and foreign language requirements further enhance the students' international experience. Study abroad experiences are an essential element of the international business program. It is required that every international business major participate in a study abroad program or complete an international internship unless they receive an exemption from the program director.
The BSIB is divided into a common business core applicable to all business students, the International Business core, a concentration in a functional area, the Languages, Literatures, and Cultures requirement, and area studies requirements. 
Business Study Abroad
The College of Business has partner institutions in various parts of the world including Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Additional partnerships are under development. The College coordinates short term, summer, year long and semester programs as well as international internships. Students should begin exploring study abroad early in their studies but plan to study abroad during their junior year in most cases. Study abroad programs are conducted in English unless the student chooses to study a language while abroad. Beyond the College of Business exchanges, many of the ISU exchanges also offer some business courses. First, explore the ISU Study Abroad website for the current list of College of Business programs and all ISU study abroad opportunities. Second, make an appointment with a Study Abroad Advisor to understand your choices. Third, consult your academic advisor to plan the best time to travel and how to arrange course requirements to maximize your learning abroad. All credits earned abroad transfer back into your degree, but courses taken abroad must be approved to meet course requirements.

Students in the Food, Nutrition and Dietetics major must complete one of the following sequences.
Dietetics Sequence
The Dietetics sequence is a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The DPD program is an integrative program that prepares graduates for careers that influence the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities through the knowledge of food and nutrition. The program prepares students for supervised practice leading to the eligibility for the CDR credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist. This sequence provides the first step for students wanting to become a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). To become an RDN, students must apply for an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after graduation, and, upon completion, are eligible to take the registration examination. Beginning January 1, 2024, a minimum of a master’s degree will be required for eligibility to take the registration examination for dietitians. An ACEND Verification Statement of DPD Completion will be given to students completing this sequence meeting program requirements. This official statement is required for graduates to begin an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after acceptance, and for other professional applications requiring verification of DPD completion. The DPD program at Illinois State University is currently accredited by the ACEND of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ACEND is recognized by the United States Department of Education and can be contacted at 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 800-877-1600, Ext 5400.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

Military Science Program
General Department Information
Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) is designed to be completed concurrently with the student’s academic degree. Students can complete the first two years of ROTC with absolutely no military service obligation. Veterans, National Guardsmen, Army Reservists, and students who complete a four week leadership course at Fort Knox, Kentucky receive constructive credit for the first two years (6 credit hours) of ROTC, and can complete the ROTC program in as few as two school years. Freshman through senior ROTC courses are offered every semester. These academic courses progress from introducing the student to the Army’s mission and organization, studying leadership principles and traits, to teaching students the duties and responsibilities required of officers in the twenty-first century. Each class has a leadership laboratory that meets once a week. At lab, freshmen through senior students train on basic military skills and receive the opportunity to develop leadership skills through hands-on application. Some of the skills learned during lab include rappelling, water survival training, rifle marksmanship, first aid and CPR, map reading and land navigation, and basic tactics.
Enrolled students in the ROTC program will also have the opportunity to compete for and participate in cultural exchange programs, military internships, and professional internships with several government agencies in the varying fields such as criminal justice, nursing, and information technology.  In addition to regular on-campus training and activities, ROTC offers exciting and challenging weekend field training exercises during the school year. Trips include a staff ride, an orientation visit to Fort Knox, Kentucky, and trips to local National Guard training areas to practice marksmanship, land navigation, and tactical skills.
Financial Aid
Military Science students can receive outstanding financial aid through Federal and State Army ROTC scholarships. Federal ROTC scholarships are awarded for a four, three, or two-year period. Students compete at the national level for these scholarships. Each scholarship can pay up to the full tuition and fees each semester, provides a book allowance of $1,200 a year, and a tax free monthly living allowance of $420, depending on scholarship status. 
State ROTC tuition waivers are awarded by the Professor of Military Science at Illinois State University. The Redbird Battalion awards up to forty of these scholarships each semester to students in the ROTC program. 
Extracurricular Activities
Several clubs complement the ROTC academic curriculum, and help students enjoy their college experience more.  Ranger Club trains intensively on military skills such as land navigation, patrolling, and rappelling. They sponsor the annual Ranger Challenge competition in which a group of ten cadets are tested on individual and team military skills. The Illinois State University Ranger Challenge team competes with other university ROTC Ranger Challenge teams from around the geographical region in an intercollegiate competition.
Rifle Club fires .22 caliber and precision air rifles weekly at an indoor rifle range. They also participate in marksmanship competitions with other university ROTC programs during the school year, with the opportunity to compete at the National Collegiate level.
The Redbird Color Guard presents the national colors at home football and basketball games, as well as other local community events.
Career Opportunities
Students who complete the ROTC program receive a commission as a second lieutenant in the Army after graduation. The student has the option of serving in the National Guard or Army Reserve as a part time career, or on active duty in the Regular Army as a full time profession. ROTC graduates can also receive a minor in Military Science by applying through the Military Science Department.
Lieutenants in the Army lead soldiers, while managing equipment, vehicle fleets, and financial resources. New lieutenants are routinely put in charge of and lead groups of up to fifty soldiers shortly after college graduation.
Officer career specialties in the Army are as diverse as those found in the civilian sector. Some of the seventeen specialties students can request as an Army officer include: Aviation, Cyber, Engineering, Finance, Medical Service Corps, Military Intelligence, Military Police, Nursing, Personnel Management, Signal, or Transportation. Except for Nursing, an officer’s specialty in the Army does not have to be related to his or her academic degree in college.
New lieutenants who go into the Regular Army serve on Active Duty for four years, and may then transfer into the Reserve Component. Lieutenants commissioned in the National Guard or Army Reserve will serve their entire eight year obligation in the Reserves.
Minor in Military Science
Admission into the Military Science Minor program is by permission of the Department Chairperson following a special interview concerning eligibility and entry requirements. Interested students should make arrangements for an interview as early as possible but not later than the second semester of their sophomore year.

Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) Program
Degree Offered: M.F.A.
The Master of Fine Arts in Art is a 60-hour program that emphasizes both theory and practice in the production, history, and teaching of the visual arts. Candidates will be expected to demonstrate artistic proficiency in at least one of the following disciplines: painting and drawing, sculpture and expanded media, printmaking, video, ceramics, photography, or glass. Candidates will also be expected to demonstrate proficiency in written and oral communication.
Students may also engage in an internship or apprenticeship. This may take the form of a guided teaching experience or work in a professional area related to the student's area of interest. The exact nature of this experience will be worked out through counseling between the major advisor and the student and will be tailored to best suit the needs of each student. This project will be subject to approval of the student's graduate committee and the School Director.
It should be understood that the accumulation of 60 semester credit hours is not the primary criterion in evaluating a student’s final achievement. The primary criterion in the evaluation of the MFA degree will be a Thesis Exhibition which demonstrates intellectual maturity and artistic proficiency in the student’s major studio area. In addition to the Thesis Exhibition, the MFA degree requires the completion of a Thesis Supportive Statement, which is a critical essay that focuses on the student’s studio work, its development, and its cultural and historical references. The M.F.A. Candidate will be required to pass an oral defense.
This 60-hour degree program requires:
36 semester hours must be taken in the Wonsook Kim School of Art, of these at least 24 must be at the 400 level
24 semester hours must be in the student's major studio area, of these at least 18 must be at the 400 level
Of the total required 60 hours, 12 semester hours must be taken in art history, or nine hours may be taken in art history with three hours in related areas such as aesthetics, philosophy, or anthropology, or ART 494 MFA Seminar
3 hours: ART 494 MFA Seminar. Taking the MFA Seminar to satisfy Art History requirements does not substitute for this requirement (494 is included within the 36 hours)
6 hours: ART 496 M.F.A. Exhibition and Supportive Statement. This will involve a comprehensive exhibition of studio work, an exhibition-related written project, and a comprehensive oral examination. A candidacy review must take place before a student can enroll in ART 496 or schedule the MFA exhibition and must include approval of proposal for the supportive statement. (496 is included within the 36 hours.)
The School reserves the right to keep images of original work produced by graduate students for educational and archival purposes.

Facility and Space Use
How to Reserve a University Facility or Space
How to Reserve a University Facility or Space
Contact the scheduling coordinator for the facility or space you want to use to check on its availability.
Complete the required forms to reserve the facility or space.
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the event planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (e.g., security staff; Emergency Medical Service personnel; other security; insurance requirements; and related loss prevention measures).
Reservations for facilities and spaces are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the event planner will work with the individual or organization sponsoring the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances.
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. Events may be evaluated for the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
The department or unit that reserves and oversees the facility or space will provide an agreement to the party requesting the reservation that defines the date, time and location for the event or activity and expectations for security, insurance, and safety regarding the event along with any additional special requirements.
The reservation is complete when the agreement is signed by both parties and all expectations and requirements are met.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Beginning freshmen must meet Illinois State University admission requirements prior to being considered into a College of Business major. Students are strongly encouraged to complete a rigorous high school math sequence as they prepare for admission into a College of Business major.
Transfer students must have met all university admission requirements (transferring from other universities or colleges) or be in academic good standing (transferring from majors within Illinois State University). The College of Business reserves the right to maintain a balanced enrollment; the number of students who continue in the program may vary from year to year depending on program capacity and the qualifications of students in the pool.
In addition, transfer students must meet the following criteria:
Students desiring to transfer with fewer than 45 credit hours completed or in progress when they apply to become a business major are evaluated based upon their college coursework, GPA (where an established GPA exists), and College of Business admission criteria for incoming freshmen.
Students desiring to transfer with between 45-59 credit hours completed or in progress when they apply to become a business major are evaluated based upon their college coursework, GPA, and College of Business admission criteria.
Students desiring to transfer with 60 credit hours or more completed or in progress when they apply to become a business major are evaluated based upon their college coursework, GPA, and College of Business admission criteria. The College requires that these transfers, in their first semester at Illinois State, complete BUS 100 with a grade of C or better and prove computer competency (spreadsheet usage, presentation software, and Web page construction) through completion of one of the following courses or their equivalents:
BIS 167
IT 150
IAI BUS 902
Course Equivalent Transfer Policies
In addition to the general requirements of the University and the College, the following policies apply to transfer students from other academic institutions seeking a business degree:
Credit for business and related courses from 2-year institutions may be transferred and applied to the business core but is limited to 100-level (lower-division freshman and sophomore) course placement.
Credit for business and related courses from baccalaureate degree granting institutions may be transferred and applied to the business core and to the major if the course for which the credit is being transferred is at the equivalent level of the Illinois State University course, contains the same course content and requires equivalent prerequisites.
Each student must successfully complete the college capstone course (MGT 385) and their major’s designated capstone course at Illinois State University and must earn at least 50 percent of the business credit hours required for the degree at Illinois State University. Please contact an academic advisor for information concerning specific majors’ capstone courses.
Academic Requirements
The academic requirements of the University apply to all of the programs in the College of Business. In addition, the following special academic requirements apply to all students in the College of Business:
Required courses in the major with grades below C will not count toward the graduation requirements of College of Business majors.
Students must have a 2.00 GPA or higher at Illinois State in order to graduate with a business degree. Business Education majors must earn and maintain a 2.50 major and cumulative GPA through graduation.
Students majoring in business must complete their senior year (30 hours) in residence at Illinois State University. Under unusual circumstances the Dean of the College of Business may grant a modification of this requirement.
Each student must successfully complete the college capstone course (MGT 385) and their major’s designated capstone course at Illinois State University, and must earn at least 50 percent of the business credit hours required for the degree at Illinois State University.
Enrollment in 200-level business courses requires 45 completed semester hours. Enrollment in 300-level business courses requires 75 completed semester hours. This policy is strictly enforced.
Students who go on probation a second or subsequent time will be dropped from the College of Business.
The College of Business strictly enforces a two graded attempt policy for any and all courses included in any business major or minor. As such, the college only allows a student to repeat a course in his or her business major or minor once. If a satisfactory grade is not earned in the second attempt, the student will be dismissed from their College of Business major or minor. Students who earn a WX grade in either attempt must apply for permission to complete a third enrollment. A student may not enroll for a third time in any required course in their business major or minor if they have already received letter grades (A, B, C, D, or F) in two previous attempts. Students pursuing majors or minors outside the College of Business that include one or more business courses as requirements will also be held to the College’s two-graded attempt policy.
Students-at-large and graduate students must apply for permission from the College of Business to register for business courses. Such students will be required to furnish official transcripts to show that prerequisite requirements have been fulfilled. Some courses in the College have restricted and/or limited enrollments and may not be an option. These students, as all non-business majors, are restricted to 27 hours of business course work.
Non-business Majors Taking Business Courses
Non-business majors are limited to no more than 27 credits of business coursework.

Honors in History
Honors work in the Department of History has been designed to offer to qualified undergraduates the opportunity to develop an independent, individualized program of study while working closely with departmental faculty in the field of their special interest. Students who complete the requirements will graduate with Departmental Honors, which will be noted on their transcript and diploma.
Honors Admissions Requirements
To be admitted to the Honors Program, stu­dents must: (1) be members of the University Honors Program, and (2) have completed 45 hours, at least nine hours in history with a minimum GPA of 3.50 in History. Recom­mendation of at least one member of the departmental faculty is required as is the approval of the Departmental Honors Advi­sor. Students may also be invited to apply by a faculty member. In specific cases these requirements may be waived but only with the express approval of the Departmental Honors Advisor and the History Department Chairperson.
Honors Study Requirements
In order to graduate with distinction as a Departmental Honors Scholar in the Department of History, the student must complete (1) at least 6 hours of Honors work in the major - HON/HIS 299, HIS 301 (which require pre-approval from the Departmental Honors Advisor), (2) all university graduation requirements, (3) all regular requirements for the major, and (4) all University Honors requirements as outlined in the catalog.

Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of History participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors and one interdisciplinary major at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the Major in European Studies and the following minors: African-American Studies; African Studies; Classical Studies; European Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies; Native American Studies; Urban Studies; and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Program section.
Major in History
Admission to the History major, including the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, may be restricted by the lack of available Department resources.
The Department of History encourages stu­dents seeking a bachelor’s degree to develop both global and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of history and to apply these methods to their studies in other disciplines. To develop their skills in historical analysis and to learn to think critically about histori­cal accounts, students complete HIS 100, HIS 200, and HIS 300. To acquire both a well-rounded and a global understanding of historical processes, students are required to take 6 hours each in the 3 fields of European, non-Western, and United States History.
The Department of History recognizes the value of language to the study of history from a global perspective. For this reason, the department recommends that all students majoring in history complete a Bachelor of Arts program. Those students majoring in history but choosing to pursue a Bachelor of Sciences program must complete a minor program.
Students in the History major must complete one of the following sequences.
General History Sequence
B.A. students are encouraged to improve their career opportunities by minoring in another discipline. B.A. students not opting for a minor must choose an area of concentration by taking a minimum of 9 hours in any field other than history or foreign language; at least 3 of these hours must be in 200- or 300-level courses. B.A. students are encouraged to continue their language studies beyond the 12 hours required by the Bachelor of Arts.
B.A. and B.S. students in either the History (non-teaching) or History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence must complete HIS 100 during their freshman year as History majors and should complete HIS 200 before enrolling in any 300-level History course.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

Admitted Transfer Students
Already admitted? Congratulations!
As a transfer student, you’re an important part of our campus community. We want you to start your transfer on the right track. You probably have a lot of questions about your next steps. Review the acceptance letter that has been emailed to you with your next steps.
Activate Your Admitted Student Account
Now that you’ve been admitted, many of the steps on this checklist will require you to access your admitted student account. To begin, follow the activation steps at IllinoisState.edu/Activate.
You’ll need your University ID (UID), which is included in your acceptance letter that was emailed to you.

Apply for Financial Aid
Your first step is completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA is available beginning December, and we encourage you to complete it as soon as possible for full consideration.  Financial aid offer letters will be sent during the month of April for summer/fall students and the month of October for spring students if the FAFSA and all requested documents have been submitted.
Our student employment fairs and ISU Jobs online database make it easy to find employment—a great source of additional financial support.

Need to Take a Math Placement Assessment?
Your Illinois State academic advisor will help you determine whether you need to take the assessment. Before you register for a math class at Illinois State, you must either take the ALEKS Math Placement Assessment or complete an appropriate prerequisite course with a grade of C or better.
Submit a Housing and Meal Plan Contract

Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

 Minor in African-American Studies 
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The Minor in African-American Studies provides an interdisciplinary approach to the examination of black politics and life in the United States. This program is designed to be of interest to students who want to explore the many contributions African-Americans have made to the political, historical, social, and artistic fabric of the United States. Students are required to take a core of two courses on African-American history and literature, as well as elective courses in the social sciences (History, Sociology, and Politics and Government) and in the humanities and fine arts (English, Music, and Theatre and Dance), and in interdisciplinary programs (including relevant course offerings in Interdisciplinary Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies).

 Minor in African Studies 
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
A Minor in African Studies will complement a major in several disciplines. It is therefore designed as a multi-disciplinary program where the student will take courses in the social sciences, arts, and humanities (English; Geography; History; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; Music; Politics and Government; Sociology/Anthropology; and Theatre and Dance). The Minor will provide students with a broad background in African history, societies, culture, and politics. The program is directed towards students with a view of visiting or working in Africa or those who are interested in government or public service careers.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

Notes
A maximum 6 hours of POL 398a01, IDS 398a02 and LGS 398a20 may count toward major.
Accelerated master 's degree (AMD) programs offer high achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor 's degree and master 's degree in a faster time frame than each degree separately. Students will take both graduate and undergraduate classes when they have junior or senior status and seamlessly transition into their master 's degree program. Students admitted into an accelerated master 's degree program may count a maximum of twelve (12) hours or 33% of course work (whichever is higher) towards both the bachelor 's degree and master 's degree. The coursework requires approval of the academic advisor.
Students must complete at least one graduate course as an undergraduate to be considered in the accelerated master’s degree program. If the student does not complete at least one graduate course, or chooses to withdraw from the accelerated program, they will be placed back in their original degree program.

Reserving Facilities 
To request space at University Galleries, complete the Facility Request form.
This request must be submitted to University Galleries at least ten business days before the proposed event. If the event includes catering, a workshop, an invited speaker, and/or minors, we require a minimum of fifteen business days notice. The facility cannot book past 8 p.m. Clients may not reserve a gallery for weekly or monthly meetings due to the shifting nature of available space determined by the exhibitions on view.
Exhibition Liability
University Galleries regularly rotates exhibitions. The number of staff required to tend to the artwork and the insurance value of artworks changes with the exhibitions. For this reason, University Galleries' definition of whether events are appropriate for the space also changes.
University Galleries cannot host dances, weddings, or fashion shows. We do not allow fog machines, candles, or pyrotechnics of any kind. Clients may not reserve a gallery for dance, theatre, martial arts, or other physical practices that may pose a risk to the artwork on view or events that are not in line with the purpose of the space.
Capacity
University Galleries reaches capacity at 192 people. Events that require capacity beyond 175 throughout the space will be denied. Events that require lecture seating beyond 90 guests will likely be denied without further documentation.
Town of Normal
University Galleries' space is leased from the Town of Normal. We do not approve events scheduled for the outside of our facility. Any events or happenings outside of the facility must be approved by the Town. Please request contact information if needed.

Major in Sociology
Sociology majors at Illinois State explore a diverse range of topics and learn to think critically about the social world. Our distinguished faculty members are committed to helping students develop the analytical skills they need to gain a deeper understanding of the world in which we live.
Sociologists look under the surface of social life. They analyze data and develop theories in order to understand and explain social patterns, issues, and problems. Sociology not only helps us understand the roots of these issues and problems, but can also help inform policies that contribute to their solutions.

Major in Anthropology
Anthropology is a discipline concerned with people in their entirety: our evolution and physical variation, the remnants of our prehistoric past, the cultural and linguistic diversity of human societies past and present.
Anthropology has four subfields: archaeology, anthropological linguistics, cultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. An anthropological education begins with learning the fundamentals. This means taking courses representative of all four subfields.
Students in the Anthropology major must complete one of the following sequences.
Anthropology Sequence

Accelerated Anthropology Sequence

Program Admission Requirements
The Accelerated Anthropology Sequence (AAS) is a pathway to the Master’s Program in Anthropology. Accelerated degree programs offer high-achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor’s degree and master’s degree with one additional year of study. Students accepted to the sequence will be allowed to take courses during their senior year that will count toward both the undergraduate and graduate programs in anthropology. Qualifying students must apply to the AAS in the spring semester of their junior year. Admission is based on space availability and competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures and deadlines are available on the Anthropology Program website.
Acceptance into the AAS constitutes acceptance into the Master’s Program in Anthropology and thus students will take up to 12 hours of graduate-level credits during their senior year. To transfer to graduate-only status for their second year, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the Master’s Program in Anthropology in the spring of their senior year. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing and have made good progress towards their M.A. degree during their senior year.
A maximum of 12 of the total 15 hours of elective courses may be taken for graduate credit
Some 300-level courses are offered for undergraduate or graduate credit. Students in the Accelerated Sequence who want to count a 300-level course toward their 12 hours of required graduate coursework, must enroll in the 300-level course for graduate credit at the beginning of the course in order for it to count.
To graduate in this sequence, a student must take at least one course for graduate credit during the senior year. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure approval.
Notes
The following anthropology courses may be taken by anthropology majors to fulfill General Education requirements but do not count towards electives for the major: ANT 143, ANT 176, ANT 197
All anthropology majors are encouraged to take SOC 275 (Social Statistics) as part of their undergraduate curriculum, however no Sociology courses may be counted toward the 40 hours in Anthropology required for the major
Special topics courses (ANT 306 and ANT 383) vary from semester to semester may be taken twice for credit if the content is different.
All Graduate School admission deadlines and policies apply to courses for graduate credit
Minor in Anthropology
18 total credit hours in Anthropology required
Required courses
ANT 102

At least 9 credit hours must be at the 200-level or higher

Admission/Retention Requirements
All incoming undergraduate students are initially enrolled in the B.A. or B.S. programs, depending on their interests. Those who wish to apply to the B.F.A. program do so no earlier than the first semester during their sophomore year. 
The School of Art expects regular class attendance and supports faculty members who choose to reduce course grades for lack of participation, including excessive absences.
Students seeking admission to the Major in Art must comply with criteria established by the School of Art, including submission of a portfolio of work for review by the School. Students interested in the Art History Sequence will submit a statement explaining their interest in the field, in lieu of the portfolio. Specific requirements for the portfolio and statement may be obtained from the School office.
To graduate with a Major in Art (B.A., B.S.) students must complete all requirements of one of the School of Art’s Sequences: Studio Arts, Graphic Design, Art History, or Teacher Education. They must also earn grades of C or better and maintain a 2.50 GPA in all courses taken in the School of Art, in addition to maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00. Individual sequences may have higher requirements. Courses in the Major may be repeated no more than once for the purpose of attaining the necessary minimum grade. Students may not enroll for the next course in a related series until the minimum grade in the prerequisite course is achieved. Incoming transfer students must retake courses considered equivalents to courses in the Major for which they earned lower than a grade of C. Students who do not meet these criteria will be placed on probation with the School of Art; a student placed on probation more than once will be dropped from the School.
Admission to some Sequences in Art may be restricted by the lack of available School resources, especially in times of oversubscription. 
In times of oversubscription and limitations on resources within the School of Art, some Discipline Areas may require faculty screening of students’ supportive materials before allowing individual students to enroll in the second course in that Discipline.
All Sequences in the Major in Art require successful completion of the Art History Core, the Foundations program appropriate to that sequence, a series of courses specific to the chosen sequence, and electives in Art. Students must complete all Sequence Foundations courses before being permitted to continue in one of the sequences in the Art major; gifted students may be allowed to take 200-level courses in their areas of interest during the freshman year, pending approval of the School. Students must also complete all Art History Core courses before they may enroll in 300-level Art History courses.
Students must make every effort to complete the required Foundations courses in their first three semesters in the program. Under most circumstances students will formally declare intention to enter a particular sequence in the Art major by the second semester of the sophomore year. Students will arrange to participate in screening requirements for their preferred sequence; those not accepted into competitive sequences may be reconsidered the following semester and should consult with appropriate faculty for advice before rescreening. Also in the sophomore year, students will begin enrolling in courses appropriate to their sequence of interest. In the case of the Studio Arts Sequence, this also requires declaring a specific Discipline Area in consultation with the School’s academic advisor.
Students can begin to take Graphic Design courses after they have completed the Art History core and Studio Art Foundation courses. There is no portfolio review for admission but students must have and maintain a major and cumulative 2.50 GPA. Students whose cumulative or major GPA falls below 2.50 will not be allowed to register for Graphic Design courses until the GPA has been raised to a 2.50 or higher. Consult the School of Art for further information on admission and retention in the Graphic Design sequence.
Students will be admitted to the Art History Sequence with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 and grades of B or better in ART 155 and ART 156. See the School of Art office for more information. Students will be allowed to continue in the sequence if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 2.50.
All Art majors planning to become licensed teachers must apply for and be admitted to the University Teacher Education program. Grades of C or better in all Art and Education courses, and a 2.50 cumulative and major GPA are required by the Art Teacher Education Area for admission and retention in the Art Teacher Education sequence. Continuation in the Art Teacher Education Sequence is not automatic. Students’ performance will be evaluated each semester.
The sequence in Teacher Education may also be combined with a sequence in Studio Arts, Graphic Design, or Art History. Pursuing a double sequence may require additional semesters. However, this option is strongly recommended to prepare students for teaching art. Students are also encouraged to take coursework in Urban Education and Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. 
Students may apply to the B.F.A. Degree program beginning in their sophomore year. Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the School of Art for the competitive review that is part of the admission process. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

Students can then apply to the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors. All accreditation information for the Dietetics Sequence applies to the Dietetics Accelerated Sequence. Students in the Dietetic Accelerated Sequence are encouraged to apply to ISU’s Track Two Dietetic Internship during the Spring Match in their senior year. The Dietetic Internship would take place following the senior year and be incorporated into the master’s degree.
Program Admission Requirements for New and Continuing Students: High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree.

Food and Beverage Management Sequence
The Food and Beverage Management sequence prepares graduates for careers in the growing food industry by combining business and management principles with food service and hospitality skills. This sequence requires fewer science courses (no organic and biochemistry) and more business and food-related courses than the dietetics sequence. Consumers spend about 50 percent of their food dollars in restaurants, cafeterias, fast-food franchises, at work, or at school. Food systems managers organize these operations and make sure the foods are attractive, nutritious, and safely prepared. This sequence meets the requirements to become eligible to take the Certified Dietary Manager Credentialing Exam. Popular career options include restaurant manager, cafeteria manager, caterer, and corporate, hospital, long-term care, or school food service manager. Employment opportunities also exist with companies that produce food, food ingredients, or processing equipment, and food safety inspection, food sales, marketing, and business management.

The Interior Design program prepares students to design innovative, functional, supportive, and responsible interior environments that positively impact the quality of life within a global market. The curriculum develops students’ skills and knowledge in design, sketching and technical drawing, space planning, interior construction and building systems, materials specifications, historical interiors, building codes and accessibility guidelines. Sustainability issues and universal design are emphasized. The program is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA) and focuses on the broad range of specialties within commercial interior design.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

Actuarial Science Sequence
This sequence of the major is designed to teach the students the mathematical founda­tions of actuarial science, and to prepare them for careers as actuaries in a variety of fields dealing with the risk of potential finan­cial losses, such as life insurance, health in­surance, financial risk management, property/casualty/liability insurance, pensions, or employee benefits.
View Actuarial Science Sequence Course Requirements
Statistics Sequence
This sequence of the major is designed to prepare students for statistical work in industry and government. In addition to learning the mathematical foundation in statistics, students study at least two cognate areas of application of statistics from Biometrics, Computer Science, Econometrics, Finance and Psychometrics. This will allow students to experience many fields of statistical applications and select a field of their choice for a career. It is to the advantage of the student to have a minor or double major in one of the above areas. However, it is not a requirement for the sequence. Senior students in good standing are encouraged to take upper level applied statistics courses from selected cognate areas.

Graduation Requirements
These are general requirements for all students. Students may apply for and receive two bachelor's degrees at the same time. Refer to the Academic Policies and Practices section of the catalog for details.
120 minimum total credit hours
A minimum of 40 of the 120 total hours must be senior college hours (200-300 level courses)
AMALI requirement (certain courses in General Education and/or major may fulfill the AMALI requirement)
IDEAS (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Access in U.S. Society) requirement (certain courses in General Education and/or major may fulfill the IDEAS requirement)
Students completing a Bachelor of Science degree must complete a B.S. - Science, Math, & Technology degree requirement (beyond the General Education requirements) 
Students completing a Bachelor of Arts degree must complete a B.A. - world language degree requirement: LAN/FRE/GER/SPA/ITA/JPN/POR 115 (or equivalent) 
Some majors complete other types of degrees that do not include additional graduation requirements. For example, the Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S. in Ed.) or the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.). 
General Education Requirements
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
The first way is to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program (see below for details).
The second way is to complete the Illinois Transferable General Education Core Curriculum available through the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) (see below for details).
The third way is to complete a baccalaureate-oriented Associates Degree (A.A. or A.S.) from a regionally accredited post-secondary institution. For those transferring from an Illinois college or university, the A.S. degree must include the complete IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) or the student must complete the GECC to fulfill Illinois State’s General Education requirement.
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours). Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses. Depending on their major, students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major.

Notes
Enrollment in 200-level business courses requires 45 completed credit hours. Enrollment in 300-level business courses requires 75 completed credit hours.
Courses for the language requirement and area studies requirement are often able to also meet general education requirements. Thus, careful consultation early in the IB program can reduce the number of hours needed to complete it.
IB majors are required to have an international experience consisting of a least one month abroad for a study abroad or an international internship. If this is a concern, there is an exemption process through the Director of the Carson and Iris Varner International Business Institute.

Dietetics Sequence
The Dietetics sequence is a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The DPD program is an integrative program that prepares graduates for careers that influence the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities through the knowledge of food and nutrition. The program prepares students for supervised practice leading to the eligibility for the CDR credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist. This sequence provides the first step for students wanting to become a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). To become an RDN, students must apply for an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after graduation, and, upon completion, are eligible to take the registration examination. Beginning January 1, 2024, a minimum of a master’s degree will be required for eligibility to take the registration examination for dietitians.

Notes
Enrollment in 200-level business courses requires 45 completed credit hours. Enrollment in 300-level business courses requires 75 completed credit hours.
Courses for the language requirement and area studies requirement are often able to also meet general education requirements. Thus, careful consultation early in the IB program can reduce the number of hours needed to complete it.
IB majors are required to have an international experience consisting of a least one month abroad for a study abroad or an international internship. If this is a concern, there is an exemption process through the Director of the Carson and Iris Varner International Business Institute.
