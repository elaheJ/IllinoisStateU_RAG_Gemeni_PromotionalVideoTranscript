Leadership and Management
The Master of Science in Nursing is distributed among core, support, and nursing specialty courses. 34-44 semester hour program (depending on sequence chosen).
All students must successfully complete a synthesis project within the specified capstone course from each sequence. NUR 477 is the capstone course identified for the Family Nurse Practitioner sequence, NUR 483 is the capstone course identified for the Leadership and Management (NLM) sequence. Those students interested in research and doctoral study may choose to complete a thesis that would result in additional degree hours.
The master’s program is developed based on nationally recognized standards for graduate education in nursing. All courses applied toward the degree must be completed at the 400 level or above. In order to maintain clinical proficiency, students who have completed the final practicum course for their enrolled sequence but who do not meet the requirements for graduation must enroll in ongoing practicum independent study (NUR 400) until graduation. A contract outlining the specific requirements for the Independent Study will be developed between the Director of Graduate Programs and the student.

Admission/Retention Requirements
All incoming undergraduate students are initially enrolled in the B.A. or B.S. programs, depending on their interests. Those who wish to apply to the B.F.A. program do so no earlier than the first semester during their sophomore year. 
The School of Art expects regular class attendance and supports faculty members who choose to reduce course grades for lack of participation, including excessive absences.
Students seeking admission to the Major in Art must comply with criteria established by the School of Art, including submission of a portfolio of work for review by the School. Students interested in the Art History Sequence will submit a statement explaining their interest in the field, in lieu of the portfolio. Specific requirements for the portfolio and statement may be obtained from the School office.
To graduate with a Major in Art (B.A., B.S.) students must complete all requirements of one of the School of Art’s Sequences: Studio Arts, Graphic Design, Art History, or Teacher Education. They must also earn grades of C or better and maintain a 2.50 GPA in all courses taken in the School of Art, in addition to maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00. Individual sequences may have higher requirements. Courses in the Major may be repeated no more than once for the purpose of attaining the necessary minimum grade. Students may not enroll for the next course in a related series until the minimum grade in the prerequisite course is achieved. Incoming transfer students must retake courses considered equivalents to courses in the Major for which they earned lower than a grade of C. Students who do not meet these criteria will be placed on probation with the School of Art; a student placed on probation more than once will be dropped from the School.
Admission to some Sequences in Art may be restricted by the lack of available School resources, especially in times of oversubscription. 
In times of oversubscription and limitations on resources within the School of Art, some Discipline Areas may require faculty screening of students’ supportive materials before allowing individual students to enroll in the second course in that Discipline.
All Sequences in the Major in Art require successful completion of the Art History Core, the Foundations program appropriate to that sequence, a series of courses specific to the chosen sequence, and electives in Art. Students must complete all Sequence Foundations courses before being permitted to continue in one of the sequences in the Art major; gifted students may be allowed to take 200-level courses in their areas of interest during the freshman year, pending approval of the School. Students must also complete all Art History Core courses before they may enroll in 300-level Art History courses.
Students must make every effort to complete the required Foundations courses in their first three semesters in the program. Under most circumstances students will formally declare intention to enter a particular sequence in the Art major by the second semester of the sophomore year. Students will arrange to participate in screening requirements for their preferred sequence; those not accepted into competitive sequences may be reconsidered the following semester and should consult with appropriate faculty for advice before rescreening. Also in the sophomore year, students will begin enrolling in courses appropriate to their sequence of interest. In the case of the Studio Arts Sequence, this also requires declaring a specific Discipline Area in consultation with the School’s academic advisor.
Students can begin to take Graphic Design courses after they have completed the Art History core and Studio Art Foundation courses. There is no portfolio review for admission but students must have and maintain a major and cumulative 2.50 GPA. Students whose cumulative or major GPA falls below 2.50 will not be allowed to register for Graphic Design courses until the GPA has been raised to a 2.50 or higher. Consult the School of Art for further information on admission and retention in the Graphic Design sequence.
Students will be admitted to the Art History Sequence with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 and grades of B or better in ART 155 and ART 156. See the School of Art office for more information. Students will be allowed to continue in the sequence if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 2.50.
All Art majors planning to become licensed teachers must apply for and be admitted to the University Teacher Education program. Grades of C or better in all Art and Education courses, and a 2.50 cumulative and major GPA are required by the Art Teacher Education Area for admission and retention in the Art Teacher Education sequence. Continuation in the Art Teacher Education Sequence is not automatic. Students’ performance will be evaluated each semester.
The sequence in Teacher Education may also be combined with a sequence in Studio Arts, Graphic Design, or Art History. Pursuing a double sequence may require additional semesters. However, this option is strongly recommended to prepare students for teaching art. Students are also encouraged to take coursework in Urban Education and Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. 
Students may apply to the B.F.A. Degree program beginning in their sophomore year. Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the School of Art for the competitive review that is part of the admission process. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor. Students will be allowed to remain in the program if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 3.00.To graduate with a B.F.A., all Studio Arts sequence students are also required to organize and present a solo exhibition of their work during the final year. This exhibition must be accompanied by a public oral presentation, an exit portfolio and a written supportive statement approved by the student's B.F.A. faculty mentors.
Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program with a Sequence in Graphic Design must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the Graphic Design faculty for a competitive review. If a student drops below a 3.00 GPA or fails a required design course, the student will no longer be able to continue in the BFA sequence, but will be able to shift their design studies to the B.A./B.S. degree offering. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor.To graduate with a B.F.A., all Graphic Design sequence students are also required to participate in and help organize a group exhibition with the other B.F.A. Graphic Design students.

In addition, students may gain professional experience in a graphic design internship. Internships will require a competitive portfolio review.
View Graphic Design Sequence Course Requirements
Art History Sequence
The Art History Sequence provides students a solid grounding in the history of art on both introductory and advanced levels. In addition, the sequence includes exposure to related disciplines outside the visual arts, training in foreign language, and experience in advanced research and writing skills. Together, these requirements prepare students for effective graduate work in Art History or other fields and for positions in a variety of art- and non-art-related fields. 
In special circumstances, students may satisfy the Art History language requirement with a language or languages other than “French, German, Italian or Spanish.” In such cases, the language(s) must be appropriate to the student’s plan of study and career goals. Alternate plans of language study must be approved by the Art History faculty in order to receive credit toward the sequence.
It is recommended that students select electives in courses related to Art History offered by the following departments/schools: Anthropology; English; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; History; Music; Philosophy; Theatre and Dance. Students are encouraged to consult with the Art History faculty for advice on choosing electives in Art History and other departments that will complement their own areas of interests. Faculty are also available for consultation on preparing for graduate school.
Students may combine Art History and Studio by declaring a second Sequence in Studio Arts and fulfilling all requirements for both sequences. This will include submitting a portfolio of art work for admission.
View Art History Sequence Course Requirements
Art Teacher Education Sequence
The Art Teacher Education Sequence is a program that emphasizes a comprehensive approach that supports state and national student learning standards and teaching performance standards in the visual arts. Also stressed are creative and critical thinking, studio techniques, understanding the learner and developing skills to become an effective teacher. Students completing this sequence are eligible to apply for teaching licensure with a K-12 endorsement for teaching art in the State of Illinois.

Undergraduate
Grading System
University Grading System
Instructors assign a grade in each course for which the student is registered. The course instructor is responsible for correcting any error in grading.
University grades assigned to undergraduate courses are:
A- Excellent
B- Good
C- Satisfactory
D- Poor, But Passing
F- Failing
Assigned to students who are (1) enrolled in a course all semester but fail to earn a passing grade, or who (2) stop attending a class without officially withdrawing
WX- Withdrawal
Assigned to students who officially withdraw from a course before the dates specified in the withdrawal policy.
CR- Credit
Assigned to students who do satisfactory work in a course which is offered only on a Credit/No Credit basis. Certain courses in the University are offered only on a Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) basis. Refer to University Policy 2.1.12 These courses must be approved in advance by the Office of the Provost.
NC- No Credit
Assigned to students who do not do satisfactory work in a course which is offered only on a Credit/No Credit basis. Certain courses in the University are offered only on a Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) basis. Refer to University Policy 2.1.12 These courses must be approved in advance by the Office of the Provost.
P- Passing*
Assigned to students who earn an A, B, or C grade in a course they have elected to take under the Passing/Not Passing (P/NP) option.  The Credit/No Credit (CT/NC) option was replaced with Pass/No Pass (P/NP) with the implementation of Campus Solutions in 2015. *For Passing/Not Passing Information refer to University Policy 2.1.12
NP- Not Passing*Assigned to students who do not earn an A, B, or C grade in a course they have elected to take under the Passing/Not Passing (P/NP) option. The Credit/No Credit (CT/NC) option was replaced with Pass/No Pass (P/NP) with the implementation of Campus Solutions in 2015.*For Passing/Not Passing Information refer to University Policy 2.1.12
I- Incomplete
An instructor may assign an incomplete (I) grade 
to a student who is doing passing work but, because of reasons beyond the student's control (such as illness), is unable to complete the required work by the end of the term. The student must have attended class to within three weeks of the close of the semester or to within one week of the close of the summer session.
The instructor must also complete the required Incomplete Grade Form found at My.IllinoisState.edu> Academics > Teaching or at the Office of the University Registrar Faculty and Staff Resources page. The form allows the instructor, student, and Department/School to acknowledge the student’s remaining requirements, deadline date, and default grade to be assigned. If neither the Incomplete Grade Form nor a Grade Change Request form is submitted, the student’s I grade will lapse to an F after one year. 
Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the University Registrar.
Students will not be allowed to graduate with an incomplete on their record.
AU- Audit
Important considerations: A class taken under the audit option does not count toward a degree; it does not count toward full-time student status for financial aid and other purposes, nor does it count toward total hours enrolled in determining registration priority. Students auditing a class will be charged all applicable tuition and fees. An auditor is expected to attend regularly. A student may register as an auditor in a class or classes if space is available. To audit, a student must obtain a Request for Auditor Registration form from the Registrar Service Center, request the instructor sign it and return the signed form to the Registrar Service Center by the published deadline.
M- Missing
Assigned when no grade has been received from the instructor after the grade submission deadline has passed.
S - Satisfactory
Assigned to students who satisfactorily complete a course offered only on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis.
U - Unsatisfactory
Assigned to students who do not satisfactorily complete a course offered only on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis.
Grade Point Average
In calculating major and cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA), the grade point equivalents are 4 for A, 3 for B, 2 for C, 1 for D, and 0 for all other grades. The 0 value of F is computed in the student’s GPA, the 0 value of grades I, AU, CR, NC, P, NP, M, and WX is not computed in the student’s GPA.
To be eligible for graduation, a student must have a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 (C) in all courses taken at Illinois State University for which grades of A, B, C, D, F are assigned. Certain majors may require a higher GPA for graduation. State licensure requirements in education majors mandate that no course in which a student receives a grade below a C can be used to fulfill a student’s required coursework in the program. Failures are considered in the total number of semester hours taken in computing the GPA.
The following table illustrates how grade points are counted to determine the GPA.

The GPA is computed by dividing grade points earned by semester hours counted for GPA. In the case above, a GPA of 2.67 is calculated by dividing 24 (total grade points) by 9 (semester hours for GPA). Grades of WX, P, NP, CR, I, and NC do not affect the GPA. 
Class Standing
Students in a bachelor’s degree program are classified as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A student must have completed 30 semester hours to be classified as a sophomore, 60 hours to be classified as a junior, and 90 hours to be classified as a senior. Students not working toward a degree at Illinois State are listed as Unclassified Students.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Admission to the English major may be affected and restricted by the lack of available Department resources in times of oversubscription. Students in the major and all sequences must pass ENG 100 with a C or better in order to advance and complete the program. 
For information about admission to this program visit the 
University’s Academics website
.
The Accelerated English Education Sequence (AEES) is an Accelerated Master's Degree (AMD) program, which serves as a pathway to the Master's in English Education. This AMD is designed for undergraduate teacher education students who, when they graduate with their undergraduate degree, will pursue employment as secondary English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. Qualifying students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher may apply to the AEES once they have reached junior status. Admission is based on competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures are available on the English Education website and applications are considered on a rotating basis each fall and spring semester. Acceptance into the AEES constitutes acceptance into the MA/MS in English Education. To transfer to graduate-only status after completing the BA in English Education, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the MA/MS in English Education. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing.

For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs and Department of Philosophy sections.
Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing. By providing a broad work experience, students not only build their portfolios, but also enter the marketplace with valuable and current skills.

Program Admission Requirements for New and Continuing Students: Admission to this academic program is limited and is based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: courses completed, cumulative GPA, hours completed, personal interview or written statement, and samples of work completed. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
Credentialing Opportunities
There is no single professional credential or certification that is necessary to pursue a career in Exercise Science. However, there are a number of optional credentialing opportunities that students are encouraged to examine. Coursework in this major is focused on the content areas needed for certification preparation by several organizations in this professional field of study. Students graduating in this major can strengthen their professional credentials by pursuing a variety of different certifications offered by organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Strength and Conditioning Association. Students interested in learning more about these recommended certification options should consult the Exercise Science Program Director in the School of Kinesiology and Recreation for further information.
Standards for Progress in the Major
Once admitted to either sequence within the Exercise Science major, the student must maintain a minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA. A student falling below the required 2.50 GPA will be placed on probation for one semester. If after one semester the 2.50 GPA has not been re-established, the student will be dropped from the Exercise Science major. A student who has been thus dropped from the Exercise Science major may reapply for admission to the major after raising his or her GPA to the required standard. The student who is not readmitted after one semester of probation and has a minimum 2.00 GPA will have the option of entering the Kinesiology Studies Sequence.
Students in the Exercise Science major must complete one of the following sequences.

Facility and Space Use
Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts Facilities
Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts Facilities
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service.  Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the College of Fine Arts.  This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as “facilities and grounds”).  These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged.  In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service.  Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn.
The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.
Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus with the exceptions noted in the Illinois State University policies and procedures. Outdoor areas such as the quad are under the oversight of Conference Services.
Scheduling and Using College of Fine Arts Spaces
Center for the Performing Arts
To schedule or reserve space in the Center for the Performing Arts, please complete the Center for the Performing Arts Request Form. All reservations for CPA spaces shall adhere to the CPA Venue Rental Policy. This includes a signed contract outlining all costs incurred and a signed Outside Group Protection of Minors policy for external organizations. All ticketing, rental, and labor fees will be negotiated and agreed upon before the event.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event will be responsible for all costs incurred including, but not limited to, clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event cease and desist. 
Centennial East – Kemp Recital Hall, Classroom Spaces
To schedule or reserve space in Centennial East, including Kemp Recital Hall, contact the School of Music Office Support Specialist, Peggy Dehaven, at 309-438-3839, or email at pldehav@ilstu.edu.
Centennial West – Westhoff Theatre, Classroom Performance Spaces
To schedule or reserve space in Centennial West, contact the School of Theatre and Dance Office Manager, Natasha Warloe, at 309-438-8784, or email at nmwarloe@ilstu.edu.
Anyone wishing to reserve space controlled by The School of Theatre and Dance must complete a room request form.
Please note that space is very limited during the academic year and all School of Theatre and Dance requests take precedence.
Administration and Procedural Application
Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the coordinator of the space will consider (a) priority for requests within the College of Fine Arts over non-College of Fine Arts requests, (b) whether the space is suitable and appropriate for the event or activity, and (c) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (e.g., security staff; Emergency Medical Service personnel; other security; insurance requirements; and related loss prevention measures).  Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity including, but not limited to:
Anticipated crowd size, density, and control, public/private, ticketed or G.A. event.
Noise likely to be generated and impact on other University activities in the vicinity.
Impact on traffic and parking.
Adequacy and suitability requested to the space.
Event history, hours, performer history, first-time event.
Compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies.
Potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others.
Presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics.
Any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section.
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for College of Fine Arts spaces are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis.  Occasions may arise when an official University or College activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the coordinator of the space will work with the individual or organization sponsoring the displaced activity to find a suitable alternative date and time reasonable under the circumstances. 
Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements.  When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets. Ultimately, it is the decision of the coordinator of the space to determine what measures or requirements are necessary.  An appeal of this decision may be made to the Dean of Fine Arts or designee.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event will be responsible for all costs incurred including, but not limited to, clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
If certain risks are associated with the proposed event or activity, the following offices may make recommendations to the Coordinator of the space as necessary.
Illinois State University Police Department
Environmental Health and Safety
Emergency Management
Risk Management
The coordinator of the space may adjust staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs. A final decision will be made after consideration of all recommendations.
Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
Events Involving Minors
If the proposed event or activity will involve minors, the sponsor or group must complete the University Program/Activities Involving Minors registration and comply with the University Protection of Minors Policy.
Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associated with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events in a College of Fine Arts space should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible.
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use College of Fine Arts facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests.  Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.
Violations or Non-Compliance Behaviors
Violation of this procedure could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including, but not limited to, the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods.  Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) will be handled through the Code of Student Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office.  Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources.  Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

Students who have no prior foreign language experience must complete SPA 111, SPA 112, SPA 115, and SPA 116. These students would need to complete 65 credit hours in the major to earn the degree.

It is recommended that Legal Studies majors enroll in POL 106
 in their first year of study. Transfer students wishing to complete the major are recommended to enroll in 
POL 106
 in their first year at Illinois State University if they have not already had an equivalent course.
LGS 398a20 may be substituted for one of the Legal Studies elective courses with consent of either the Department Chair or the Director of Legal Studies.

Visiting and Non-Degree Seeking Students
Home
Admissions
Visiting Students
Overview
A visiting student is one who does not wish to seek a degree at Illinois State University. This is an "unclassified" status in which the student is not in a degree program.
Typically these are students who are taking classes at Illinois State to transfer them to another institution or taking dual enrollment classes as a high school student. Alternatively, a visiting student may be establishing a GPA at Illinois State in hopes of being admitted to a degree program at a later time.
How to Apply
Students who are in good academic standing at their current college or university are eligible to be visiting students. If the course you wish to take has prerequisites, you must prove that you meet them by submitting an official transcript.
Visiting students may want to determine whether a course will be available prior to applying for admission. Contact the Registrar Service Center at (309) 438-2188 for assistance.
Students who have a bachelor degree must apply as a Visiting Graduate Student.
Start Application
Application Deadlines
Unclassified Status
If you attend Illinois State as a visiting student, you will be considered unclassified, which is different than being admitted to a degree program at the University. Courses you take as an unclassified student count toward your grade point average at Illinois State; however, there is no guarantee the courses you take as an unclassified student will count toward your degree should you be admitted into a degree program in the future.
Visiting students are not eligible for financial aid.
Class Registration
Some courses at Illinois State are only available to students in that major, so we cannot guarantee you will be able to take any course you wish. You can search course offerings through  Course Finder, and we will email you when course registration is available. If you need help registering for undergraduate classes, contact our academic advisors at Advising@IllinoisState.edu or (309) 438-7604. Graduate students can contact the Graduate School at GraduateSchool@IllinoisState.edu or (309) 438-2583..
Transferring Courses
If you wish to transfer the courses you take at Illinois State to another institution, we highly recommend that you consult with your academic advisor at your current institution about course transferability before you sign up for the course. Our Registrar Service Center can provide you or your institution with an official transcript.
Graduate Students
Taking Classes
Only students admitted to Illinois State as a degree student or a visiting student may take graduate classes. You should check to see whether or not the classes you want to take are available to you before submitting a visiting application. Some departments do not permit visiting student enrollment and others, because of limited staffing or physical constraints, restrict access to certain courses to their degree students. Visiting students will need to obtain a course permission/override to be eligible to register for any course at the University.
It is also recommended that you reach out to the Graduate Coordinator overseeing the graduate course you wish to complete.
Using Credits Towards a Degree
Visiting students who later decide to pursue a degree at Illinois State may petition that coursework taken as a visitor be accepted in meeting program requirements. The petition must be recommended by the program and granted by the Graduate School. Normally no more than 12 credit hours of visiting enrollment will be approved toward a degree but, under special circumstances, up to one-half of visiting credit hours may be applied. There is no guarantee or expectation that any coursework taken as a visitor will be accepted toward program degree requirements. All graduate courses taken as a visiting student will be computed into the graduate grade point average.
Connect With Your Program
If you plan to seek a graduate degree, be sure to discuss the pros and cons of visiting enrollment with the graduate coordinator of the program to which you plan to apply.
Visiting graduate students are not degree students and are, therefore, not typically eligible for most forms of financial aid.

Notes
For History (B.A.) – Students are encouraged to complete a minor, but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than History or a Foreign Language, with at least three credit hours at the senior college level.
For History (B.S.) – Major requirements are the same as for the B.A. except students must complete a minor.
* It is encouraged for students to take courses approved for graduate credit. For 300-level and 400-level courses approved for graduate credit see courses listed with (GRAD) at the History Course Directory.
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in History. In addition to the HIS 497 required course, students may choose to take up to 9 hours of graduate level electives to count towards the 9 credit hours of additional senior college level History electives required for the undergraduate program. It is strongly recommended that one of these courses be HIS 496, another required course for the MA/MS degree. Refer to the Course Finder website for 400-level graduate courses and 300-level courses that are approved for graduate credit. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure graduate-level approval. For information on graduate-level history requirements, please visit the graduate academic catalog.

Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) Program
Degree Offered: M.F.A.
The Master of Fine Arts in Art is a 60-hour program that emphasizes both theory and practice in the production, history, and teaching of the visual arts. Candidates will be expected to demonstrate artistic proficiency in at least one of the following disciplines: painting and drawing, sculpture and expanded media, printmaking, video, ceramics, photography, or glass. Candidates will also be expected to demonstrate proficiency in written and oral communication.
Students may also engage in an internship or apprenticeship. This may take the form of a guided teaching experience or work in a professional area related to the student's area of interest. The exact nature of this experience will be worked out through counseling between the major advisor and the student and will be tailored to best suit the needs of each student. This project will be subject to approval of the student's graduate committee and the School Director.
It should be understood that the accumulation of 60 semester credit hours is not the primary criterion in evaluating a student’s final achievement. The primary criterion in the evaluation of the MFA degree will be a Thesis Exhibition which demonstrates intellectual maturity and artistic proficiency in the student’s major studio area. In addition to the Thesis Exhibition, the MFA degree requires the completion of a Thesis Supportive Statement, which is a critical essay that focuses on the student’s studio work, its development, and its cultural and historical references. The M.F.A. Candidate will be required to pass an oral defense.
This 60-hour degree program requires:
36 semester hours must be taken in the Wonsook Kim School of Art, of these at least 24 must be at the 400 level
24 semester hours must be in the student's major studio area, of these at least 18 must be at the 400 level
Of the total required 60 hours, 12 semester hours must be taken in art history, or nine hours may be taken in art history with three hours in related areas such as aesthetics, philosophy, or anthropology, or ART 494 MFA Seminar
3 hours: ART 494 MFA Seminar. Taking the MFA Seminar to satisfy Art History requirements does not substitute for this requirement (494 is included within the 36 hours)
6 hours: ART 496 M.F.A. Exhibition and Supportive Statement. This will involve a comprehensive exhibition of studio work, an exhibition-related written project, and a comprehensive oral examination. A candidacy review must take place before a student can enroll in ART 496 or schedule the MFA exhibition and must include approval of proposal for the supportive statement. (496 is included within the 36 hours.)
The School reserves the right to keep images of original work produced by graduate students for educational and archival purposes.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct. The University also reserves the rights to establish additional requirements with respect to specific University venues.
In general, the University will not interfere with events, meetings, assemblies, rallies, demonstrations, vigils, or protests in public areas of University facilities and spaces unless participants engage in one or more of the following behaviors:

Continue to engage in behaviors prohibited in this section after a University official or University Police has declared that the conduct violates University policies or an applicable law and has instructed the participants to modify or
    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

Graduate Catalog Requirements
For a student who attends at least one term of each academic year, graduation requirements are specified in the Graduate Catalog for the year of first course enrollment in the degree program.
Since university programs are constantly evaluated and improved, a student may graduate under new degree requirements published the academic year their graduating from the University. A student who changes to new Graduate Catalog requirements, however, must meet all the requirements including graduation requirements, in that catalog.
Course Prerequisites
Course prerequisites may change over time and do not depend on catalog year. The registration system will enforce prerequisites in effect at time of registration.

Students completing a certificate and degree program simultaneously need to complete at least one additional course above and beyond the degree requirements. Students completing a certificate prior to admission in a graduate program may use all certificate coursework toward the degree, as the certificate acts as a gateway to the degree. This will be at the program’s discretion. There are two types of certificates available at the graduate level:
Post-Baccalaureate Certificate—requires a minimum of 9 hours beyond the baccalaureate degree, but fewer hours than a master’s degree.
Post-Masters Certificate—requires a minimum of 9 semester hours of coursework beyond the master’s degree but fewer hours than a doctoral degree.
Terms Used in Course Descriptions
The following section explains how to read and use a course description, and the terminology used within course descriptions.
Also offered as: (cross-listed course) the specified courses are identical and are thus considered interchangeable in meeting all requirements. Credit can only be earned in one of the specified courses.
Consent of the instructor: The course instructor must give consent before a student may register for the course.
Formerly offered as: indicates a course previously offered under a different number or title. The course is interchangeable with the previous course number or title.
Materials charge optional: indicates an optional fee charge for course materials.
Multiple enrollments allowed: indicates that a course may be taken for credit more than once if different content is planned; there may be a maximum amount of credit specified for the course.
Not for credit if earned: (course) means that content overlap exists between the specified courses and that students should not be able to count both toward graduation. Such courses are not, however, considered interchangeable in meeting all requirements.
Not for credit toward a graduate degree program: credit from this course may not be applied to the degree program requirements.
Variable credit courses: are those courses leading to differing number of credit hours. A student should plan with the advisor the number of hours to be sought in a variable credit course.
Course Offerings
 Courses: Course format that combines lecture and laboratory components in each class meeting.
Contract: Contract educational services, programs and courses are delivered through mutual contract to a business site for a specific cohort or business entity.
“Decimalized” Course: A course with different subtopics but standard learning outcomes; for example, ENG 409 may examine different topics. Campus Solutions replaces the decimal with the letter A, so ENG 409.01 appears as 409A01.
Directed Research: Course format used for independent study, thesis, and dissertation courses.
Distance Education: A formal education process in which the majority of the instruction occurs when student and instructor are not in the same location at the same time. Instruction may be synchronous or asynchronous.

Examples are 400 Independent Study, 393 Workshop, 499 Master’s Thesis, and 599 Doctoral Dissertation. See Course Limitation section in this catalog for additional information.
Independent Study: Intensive study in a special area of the student’s interest under the direction of a qualified member of the faculty. Each individual investigation is to culminate in a comprehensive written report and/or examination and/or artistic project.

Seminar: A regular meeting of students, under the guidance of a faculty member, in which each conducts research and exchanges information, problems, and results through informal lectures, reports, and discussion.
Temporary Course: Temporary courses are approved by the curricular committees for a time period not to exceed one year. Temporary courses often are used to experiment with a new curricular design, to take advantage of the skills of a faculty member who will be at the University for a limited period, or to respond to particular interests of students. Temporary courses are designated by the numbers 389, 489, and 589. Temporary courses may not be required within a major or sequence.
Topics Course: An organization of subject matter and related learning experiences composed of identifiable sub-divisions of topics. Each topic is of sufficient significance to be treated separately as a unit of instruction for an entire semester or term. The content of the course varies by semester.
Workshop: Intensive and applied work on special problems in one or more subject areas. Workshop opportunities are provided on special problems not covered in any regular university courses. Workshops are generally designated by the numbers 393, 429, and 493.
Course Information
The University operates on the semester plan. The credit value of all courses is stated in terms of semester hours. Ordinarily, a semester hour is assigned for a 50-minute class meeting per week for the semester; therefore, a course valued at three semester hours generally meets three periods weekly. In laboratory courses, at least two 50-minute periods per week are ordinarily required for each semester hour of credit.
In addition to its fall and spring semesters, the University provides a summer session with courses of varying lengths and a variety of short-term offerings.
Course Availability: Some courses listed at CourseFinder.IllinoisState.edu may not be available each year. Questions concerning scheduling of courses should be referred to the department chairperson or school director.
Course prerequisites are listed on Course Finder and may change over time. The registration system will enforce prerequisites in effect at time of registration.
Course Numbering System
Courses are numbered in the following order: course number (3 digits preceding the title), course title and credit value (in semester hours). Following the course description any prerequisites, restrictions on enrollment, and any special considerations are noted.
Each course bears a distinguishing number for identification and indication of its academic level. Courses 300-399 are advanced undergraduate courses and are open to juniors, seniors, and graduate students. 300-level courses approved for graduate credit are noted in Course Finder. To receive graduate credit, students must complete applicable graduate requirements provided in the course syllabus. Courses 400-499 are graduate courses. Courses 500- 599 generally are limited to terminal degree students in programs such as the Ed.D., M.F.A., Au.D., D.N.P., and Ph.D.
The numbering system for advanced courses is as follows:
300-399: Advanced undergraduate courses. Open to juniors, seniors, and sometimes graduate students.
400-499: Courses at this level are for graduate students. With approval from the instructor, the department chair/school director, and the Graduate School, advanced undergraduates may be permitted to enroll in 400-level courses for undergraduate credit only.
500-599: Courses limited to advanced graduate or doctoral students.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

This interdisciplinary minor prepares students to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in their communities. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world. The minor gives students opportunities to sharpen their analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action. The minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden their learning experience and career perspectives.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

 Minor in Ethnic Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies. 
18 credit hours required
Take 6 courses as indicated below from the following groups (at least 4 courses must be above the 100 level). With consent of the faculty advisor, students may use departmental or IDS 287, 298, or 398 courses for one course in Group II and/or one course in Group III.

Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct.

The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

Catalog
Undergraduate
Languages, Literatures and Cultures
Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language.

Graduate
Doctor of Philosophy
Doctor of Philosophy
The Doctor of Philosophy degree is designed for the preparation of individuals competent in research and scholarly inquiry whose career objectives are generally in research, teaching, consultation, or leadership roles in universities, colleges, institutes, educational agencies or private practice. 
Minor Fields
Approved 4/14/88
A doctoral student may select a minor field (or fields) of study. The selection and composition of a minor field (or fields) must have the approval of the Graduate School and the major and minor departments. A minor field may, under certain circumstances, be in the same department or school as a major field.
Curriculum Requirements
A doctoral degree is not granted on the basis of a student having successfully completed a certain number of courses, but upon evidence of scholarly attainment as demonstrated especially by competence in research.
Students may transfer up to 40% of the required program coursework, not including comprehensive exams and dissertation hours, toward the completion of the doctoral degree with approval from the department/school. The transferred coursework must be graduate level, with a grade of B or higher (or equivalent as verified on the transcript), and may or may not have been used toward another graduate level degree. The coursework being considered for transfer will be reviewed on an individual basis with final approval from the department/school.
Time Limitations
Approved 4/14/88, Updated 3/22/01
All requirements for a doctoral degree, including the dissertation, must be completed by the end of eight calendar years beginning with the date the student first registers as a doctoral degree student. This time limit applies to enrollment in all graduate coursework in the student’s program. If a course taken to complete the requirements for the doctoral degree is not taken within the eight-year period allowed for the degree program, the student’s department may require the student to retake the course for credit or allow the student to demonstrate current knowledge of the subject matter. If the latter is used, currency must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the department offering the course through successful completion of an appropriate examination or other assessment if available from the department. Courses from other institutions falling outside the limitation of time may not be used in a graduate program. When graduate study is interrupted by military service or other contingencies, the eight-year limit may be extended by the Graduate School. A Request to Extend Time to Complete Graduate Degree Program must be completed by the student, graduate coordinator/director, and if applicable, dissertation chair, and submitted to the Graduate School for approval or denial. The Request to Extend Time to Complete Graduate Degree form is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Admission to Candidacy
Approved 4/14/88
A doctoral student will be admitted to candidacy after: a Degree Audit has been submitted to the Graduate School and approved, (b) the comprehensive/preliminary examination has been successfully completed and reported to the Graduate School, (c) the research tool requirement has been met, and (d) the dissertation proposal has been approved by the dissertation committee and by the Graduate School. (Both the Degree Audit and Proposal Approval forms are available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Comprehensive/Preliminary Examination
Approved 4/14/88; edited 2/17/15; edited 9/19/17; edited 4/24/18
The comprehensive/preliminary examination is written, or, written and oral. It is also concerned with the student’s professional competence and ability to undertake independent research. The content, process, scheduling, administration, and evaluation of the examination is to be determined by each department and school. To apply for comprehensive examinations a student must:
be in good standing in a program, and
have a Degree Audit on file in the department or school,
not be on academic probation,
and have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 at the time of the examination.
A student who fails the examination must wait until the next academic term before repeating the entire examination unless there are reasons that make an exception advisable. Exceptions must be requested from the Graduate School in writing by the student and advisor/director. Students who have twice failed the examination are not to repeat the exam unless they have completed further study as prescribed by the department chair or school director. Comprehensive examinations may not be administered more than three times to individual students. Department chairs and school directors are to notify students, by letter, of examination results within thirty days from the examination date. A copy of this letter is to be sent to the Graduate School. (If it is a student’s second failure, recommendations for further study and appropriate warning of the situation are to be included in the letter.) At the point of the third failure of comprehensive examination, the department or school will recommend to the Graduate School that the student be dismissed from the degree program.
The Graduate School must receive the results from the department or school within 5 working days of notifying the student.
Registration for Dissertation Work
Approved 12/11/86
Fifteen semester hours of 599 Doctoral Research are required for the doctoral degree. Any student using the services of the academic staff or the facilities of the University must be registered for the semester or term during which the services are rendered or facilities are used. Also, to register for 599 the student must be working on the research under the direction of the advisor or dissertation chairperson. 
Continuous Registration
Approved 11/14/96; edited 4/26/23
Once admitted to candidacy in a doctoral degree program, as defined by the Admission to Candidacy policy, and after the student has completed all coursework on the Degree Audit and the required number of hours (15) of 599 Doctoral Research, the student is required to maintain continuous registration until the submission of all final deposit materials to the Graduate School. The requirement for continuous registration may be fulfilled by maintaining registration in 1 hour of 599 each semester through the semester of degree completion. (Students registering for less than 9 credit hours in fall or spring, or less than 6 credit hours in summer, will not have the insurance fee automatically assessed. (See the Health Insurance website for further information.) The requirement for continuous registration does not apply during a summer term unless the student is proposing, defending, or graduating in that term. Registration for 599 may be in absentia. If circumstances prohibit continuous registration, a student must request a leave of absence. Any student interrupting registration without obtaining a leave of absence, upon re-enrollment and/or reinstatement, must pay tuition and fees for one credit hour of 599, at the current tuition and fee rates, for each of the delinquent semesters. Any student requesting reinstatement in a degree program after a lapse of one calendar year must complete an application for readmission to the program. Continuous registration for an upcoming term may be waived if all materials are submitted to the Graduate School by the Friday before the next semester starts. Consult with the Graduate School for more information.
Full-Time Equivalency
Approved 1/27/21
If a student has completed the maximum requirement of dissertation hours for the program, but more time is needed, a student may register for a 1 credit of dissertation for up to two (2) semesters.  This 1 credit course will be counted at a level equivalent to full-time study for the purposes of loan deferment, continued use of university student services, and graduate assistant full-time enrollment eligibility requirements.  An approved PERS 938 (Reduced Course Load Request) is still required for graduate assistants enrolled in this option.
If more time is needed beyond the first two (2) semesters, a formal request for an extension can be made to the graduate school by the dissertation advisor. Extensions may be approved for a maximum of two (2) additional semesters only if a clear plan for completion has been submitted and only if the student is working at a full-time equivalency on dissertation work.  Graduate students who are using this extension cannot hold a graduate assistantship.  If the extension is approved, the full-time equivalency could be used for loan deferment or continued use of student services ONLY. 
An extension request must address the following:
An explanation of why the extension is necessary;
If the extension is being requested for one or two semesters;
Explanation of how the student is working at a full-time equivalency on dissertation work;
A timeline for completion in the requested time-frame; and
Approval of the dissertation advisor, the graduate coordinator, and the Graduate School.
Use of the 1 credit dissertation option (or extended period) may also affect the cost of attendance if a student is applying for federal and state financial aid.  Students should consult the Financial Aid department to determine how use of the option will impact the student’s eligibility for federal and state financial aid.

Dissertation Committee
Approved 4/23/92; revised 4/22/04; edited 4/26/23
A dissertation is written under the direction of a dissertation committee appointed in a manner specified by the department. Dissertation committees require a minimum of 3 people, a chair from the student’s department/school and at least two other committee members. In all cases the chair must have full graduate faculty status. The majority of the committee, which includes the chair, should have full graduate faculty status. Inquire with your department/school for any additional requirements. Proposed committee members who are not members of the Illinois State University Graduate Faculty must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies. See the “Graduate Committee Information” section on the Proposal Approval Form to indicate the faculty that need approval to serve on the committee. All committee members must have terminal degrees.
The Proposal Approval form is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Dissertation Proposal
Approved 12/11/86, updated 2/18/99
The student is required to file a Proposal Approval Form with the department or school and with the Graduate School for approval before embarking on dissertation research. Institutional policy also requires that all research proposals involving human subjects be reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Research proposals involving animals must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Research proposals involving biohazards must be reviewed by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). The dissertation for the doctorate must involve independent research and an original contribution to knowledge. See RSP.IllinoisState.edu.
Dissertation Acceptance
Approved 3/23/95, edited 2/5/08; 2/17/15
A complete draft of the dissertation must be uploaded to ProQuest before the “Right to Defend” will be issued to the student. View complete details on the completion of the dissertation.
Academic Advisor
Approved 4/14/88
Each department is responsible for advising each student upon admittance to the program and informing the student of the source of this assistance. The student's Degree Audit must have the approval of appropriate departmental or school officials and the Graduate School and should be submitted early in the student's program. For a complete listing of each program’s graduate coordinator(s) or director(s) please visit Grad.IllinoisState.edu/Faculty/Coordinators/.

The Accelerated English Education Sequence (AEES) is an Accelerated Master's Degree (AMD) program, which serves as a pathway to the Master's in English Education. This AMD is designed for undergraduate teacher education students who, when they graduate with their undergraduate degree, will pursue employment as secondary English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. Qualifying students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher may apply to the AEES once they have reached junior status. Admission is based on competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures are available on the English Education website and applications are considered on a rotating basis each fall and spring semester. Acceptance into the AEES constitutes acceptance into the MA/MS in English Education. To transfer to graduate-only status after completing the BA in English Education, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the MA/MS in English Education. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing.

The Department of English participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the following minors: African Studies, African-American Studies, Children’s Studies, Civic Engagement and Responsibility, Cognitive Science, Ethnic Studies, European Studies, International Studies, Latin American and Latino/a Studies, Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies, Native American Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and also the Minor in Religious Studies in the Department of Philosophy. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs and Department of Philosophy sections.
Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing. By providing a broad work experience, students not only build their portfolios, but also enter the marketplace with valuable and current skills.

The Food, Nutrition and Dietetics (FND) program at Illinois State University offers four sequences: Dietetics Sequence, Dietetics Accelerated Sequence, Food and Beverage Management Sequence, and Food and Beverage Management Accelerated Sequence.
Students in the Food, Nutrition and Dietetics major must complete one of the following sequences.
Dietetics Sequence
The Dietetics sequence is a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The DPD program is an integrative program that prepares graduates for careers that influence the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities through the knowledge of food and nutrition. The program prepares students for supervised practice leading to the eligibility for the CDR credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist. This sequence provides the first step for students wanting to become a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). To become an RDN, students must apply for an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after graduation, and, upon completion, are eligible to take the registration examination. Beginning January 1, 2024, a minimum of a master’s degree will be required for eligibility to take the registration examination for dietitians. An ACEND Verification Statement of DPD Completion will be given to students completing this sequence meeting program requirements. This official statement is required for graduates to begin an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after acceptance, and for other professional applications requiring verification of DPD completion. The DPD program at Illinois State University is currently accredited by the ACEND of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ACEND is recognized by the United States Department of Education and can be contacted at 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 800-877-1600, Ext 5400.
View Dietetics Sequence Course Requirements
Dietetics Accelerated Sequence
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in Dietetics/Family and Consumer Sciences. Students can then apply to the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors. All accreditation information for the Dietetics Sequence applies to the Dietetics Accelerated Sequence. Students in the Dietetic Accelerated Sequence are encouraged to apply to ISU’s Track Two Dietetic Internship during the Spring Match in their senior year. The Dietetic Internship would take place following the senior year and be incorporated into the master’s degree.
Program Admission Requirements for New and Continuing Students: High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree.

Food and Beverage Management Sequence
The Food and Beverage Management sequence prepares graduates for careers in the growing food industry by combining business and management principles with food service and hospitality skills. This sequence requires fewer science courses (no organic and biochemistry) and more business and food-related courses than the dietetics sequence. Consumers spend about 50 percent of their food dollars in restaurants, cafeterias, fast-food franchises, at work, or at school. Food systems managers organize these operations and make sure the foods are attractive, nutritious, and safely prepared. This sequence meets the requirements to become eligible to take the Certified Dietary Manager Credentialing Exam. Popular career options include restaurant manager, cafeteria manager, caterer, and corporate, hospital, long-term care, or school food service manager. Employment opportunities also exist with companies that produce food, food ingredients, or processing equipment, and food safety inspection, food sales, marketing, and business management.

Major in Interior Design
The Interior Design (ID) program at Illinois State University offers two sequences: Interior Design Sequence, and Interior Design Accelerated Sequence, which is a pathway to the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program.
Interior Design Sequence
The Interior Design program prepares students to design innovative, functional, supportive, and responsible interior environments that positively impact the quality of life within a global market. The curriculum develops students’ skills and knowledge in design, sketching and technical drawing, space planning, interior construction and building systems, materials specifications, historical interiors, building codes and accessibility guidelines. Sustainability issues and universal design are emphasized. The program is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA) and focuses on the broad range of specialties within commercial interior design. Course content is based on the knowledge and skills needed to pass the National Council for Interior Design Qualification certification exam. To be licensed in the State of Illinois, graduates of a 4-year CIDA-accredited program must have a minimum of two years professional work experience and pass the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) Examination. Passage of this exam also qualifies the individual for professional membership in interior design organizations such as International Interior Design Association (IIDA) and American Society of Interior Designers (ASID).

Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program

Curricular areas of emphasis include the study of feminist theories and methodologies, social justice and activism, LGBTQ studies, women’s histories, literatures, visual cultures, and politics.

General Education Requirements
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
The first way is to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program (see below for details).
The second way is to complete the Illinois Transferable General Education Core Curriculum available through the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) (see below for details).
The third way is to complete a baccalaureate-oriented Associates Degree (A.A. or A.S.) from a regionally accredited post-secondary institution. For those transferring from an Illinois college or university, the A.S. degree must include the complete IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) or the student must complete the GECC to fulfill Illinois State’s General Education requirement.
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours). Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses. Depending on their major, students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct. The University also reserves the rights to establish additional requirements with respect to specific University venues.

    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

Endorsing Teaching Certificates
Reading Teacher
The Illinois State Board of Education has identified six areas of study required of all teachers whose major teaching assignment is reading. All teachers assigned departmentalized responsibility in reading or language arts must meet this 24-semester hour requirement. The M.S.Ed. in Reading Program offers all coursework leading to the endorsement of a reading teacher.
Reading Specialist
Coursework leading to the Reading Specialist is offered in the M.S.Ed. in Reading and Literacy Program. The program leading to the K-12 Reading Specialist Certificate requires the completion of 36 semester hours in reading and related educational areas. Students working on the Reading Specialist must first have a current teaching certificate. Other requirements, including any tests required for certification, can be found at the Teaching and Learning website.
Post-Baccalaureate Graduate Certificate in Library Information Specialist
The Post-Baccalaureate Library Information Specialist Certificate provides 18 hours of coursework that prepares teachers to work in school libraries. The program is available to certified teachers and to students who have completed the bachelor's degree and are working on their initial certification. It is designed to help students receive endorsement as Library Information Specialist and to pass the Illinois content area examination. The course of study requires satisfactory completion of the following courses: TCH 416, TCH 440, TCH 442, TCH 445, TCH 449, and TCH 454. Some of these courses may apply as electives to a degree program. Information on admission is available from the School of Teaching and Learning.

Majors become familiar with careers in psychology and complete a capstone experience as they complete the program.

In order to remain in the major, all Psychology majors must have achieved the following by the time they have completed 75 hours: (1) maintenance of a 2.00 or higher cumulative Illinois State University GPA, (2) maintenance of a 2.20 or higher Psychology major GPA (based on all courses taken at Illinois State University that count towards the Psychology major), and (3) completion of all of the following courses with a grade of C or better: PSY 111, PSY 138, PSY 200, and PSY 231; MAT 113 or MAT 113a01 or MAT 120 or MAT 121 or MAT 144 or MAT 145; a laboratory science course.

Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct.

Performance-Based Assessment System
Effective Fall 2002, the Council for Teacher Education implemented the Teacher Education Performance-Based Assessment System (PBA). This system meets accreditation standards, as stipulated by the Illinois State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board (ISEPLB) and Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP).
The Performance Based Assessment system (PBA) establishes critical points at which candidates for teacher licensure will be assessed through two gateways:
Gateway 1: Pre-Student Teaching 
Teacher Education Orientation PBA Workshop
National Criminal Background Check (NCBC)- All teacher candidates will be required to complete a one-time, online NCBC. The NCBC reviews criminal histories to ensure the protection of preK-12 students by verifying the teacher candidate has not been convicted of illegal activity nationally.  Results of the NCBC must be reported to the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center before students may begin any clinical experience.  Additionally, the schools in which the teacher candidate will complete their clinical experiences and student teaching assignment(s) will require their own criminal background check be completed.
Clear Illinois Sexual Offender Registry
Clear Violence Against Youth Registry
Cumulative GPA of 2.5 or higher (determined by major)
Communication 110 with a grade of C or better
ENG 101 with a grade of C or better

50 Diverse clinical hours
Pass Student Teaching (with a grade of C or better)
Student Teaching Disposition Concerns Assessments
Successful completion of a teacher performace assessment as determined by the Illinois State Board of Education, except when waived or eliminated by state legislation. 
The PBA system ensures that candidates possess the knowledge, skills, performances, and dispositions requisite for successful teaching careers. When Illinois State University recommends a candidate for teacher licensure, the entire university has participated in the preparation of that teacher.
Teacher candidates will be required to attend the PBA workshop early in their education program. At this workshop, students will be provided with the information necessary to understand the requirements and how to monitor their progress. Failure to complete certain indicators at required times could delay progress in the intended major. Details regarding the performance-based system can be found on the Teacher Education (PBA) Orientation Workshop website.
The Council for Teacher Education reserves the right to modify performance assessment indicators in response to state and national accreditation mandates to reflect current practice in the teaching profession. Teacher candidates should consult with their program advisors for specific requirements for their major on a regular basis.

Theatre
The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) grants teacher/school licenses in the State of Illinois. All teacher candidates who successfully complete an approved teacher education program at Illinois State University, pass appropriate licensure exams, and meet ISBE requirements will be recommended for licensure. This does not lead to licensure in other states. Teacher candidates are responsible for checking the requirements of the state in question.
Endorsements are available at the graduate level for Chief School Business Official, Director of Special Education, Learning Behavior Specialist II, Low Vision/Blindness, Library Information Specialist, Principal, Reading Specialist, School Psychologist, School Social Worker, Speech and Language Pathologist, Superintendent, and School Nursing.
Each student who completes a bachelor’s degree program in an approved Teacher Education program, and who is recommended for licensure by the licensure officer at Illinois State University as having completed all requirements (General Education, Professional Education, field of study or area of specialization, and general teacher education requirements, and all other applicable degree requirements), is recommended for a teaching license in the State of Illinois. The Evaluations Office at Illinois State University will notify students of the correct procedures for applying for the appropriate Illinois teaching license. Application to ISBE for licensure should occur within one year of this notification. Failure to do so may result in no longer meeting licensure requirements due to state law changes. To satisfy Illinois licensure requirements and Illinois State University’s Gateway System requirements, all candidates must pass a subject matter knowledge test and a teacher performance assessment (except when waived or eliminated by state legislation). Additional tests may be required for select licensure programs and additional endorsements.
Students who have already completed one or more non-teaching degrees and now seek admission to a teacher education program are advised to seek admission to the University as a candidate for a second bachelor’s degree. Subsequent transcript analysis may determine that a second degree is not required. In this instance, the student will be allowed to complete the requirements for licensure without completing the requirements of the second bachelor’s degree.
General Education
As part of the entitlement program, the Illinois State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board will accept the same general education requirements for licensure as are accepted for graduation from that university.
Endorsements
The minimum requirements for all teaching fields and all endorsements are defined by the State of Illinois. One or more endorsements may be earned along with the completion of the teaching major by taking additional courses and a possible state test. Students should contact an advisor for information on requirements for endorsements.
Council for Teacher Education
The Council for Teacher Education is responsible for developing requirements for Teacher Education and for providing avenues of communication among all of the areas of the University concerned with teacher education.
Time Limit on Teacher Education Courses
To provide teacher candidates with current information and meet required standards, all undergraduate teacher education courses have a longevity of seven (7) years. Any teacher education program reserves the right not to accept any course older than seven years to fulfill the requirements of their program. If a course has been taken beyond a seven-year period, the course may not count towards the education degree.
Dismissal from Programs
Teacher candidates who fail to comply with teacher education requirements may be dismissed. At the option of the department or school, teacher candidates dropped from the program may pursue a degree in a non-teaching major or be classified “undeclared.”
If a student is dismissed from a teacher education program, they have a right to appeal this decision to the Council for Teacher Education. The appeal process is outlined on the Cecilia J. Lauby 
Teacher Education Center website under the heading "Rights and Responsibilities." 
Teacher candidates convicted of certain types of crimes may not be approved for licensure by the Illinois State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board.
 Clinical Experiences in Teacher Education
A variety of clinical (pre-student teaching) experiences, as well as student teaching, are included in the teacher candidate's professional preparation. Observations, small and large group instruction, tutoring, field experiences, and student teaching are included in the Clinical Experiences Program. The experiences offered prior to student teaching are integral parts of specific college courses. Clinical experiences are provided in off-campus professional development schools, local schools, campus laboratory schools, agencies, and other approved school and non-school settings. The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center monitors and documents all clinical experiences. Teacher candidates will show verification of having completed clinical experiences commensurate with attaining local, state, and national standards. Teacher candidates must provide their own transportation to clinical experiences sites.
Candidates are required to provide documentation of meeting all State of Illinois, district, and university requirements regarding criminal background checks BEFORE beginning any clinical experiences. Criminal background checks must remain current as of the last day of the clinical experience. Additionally, the schools in which the teacher candidate will complete their clinical experiences and student teaching assignments may require their own criminal background check be completed. 
The approximate number of clinical hours may be found with the appropriate course description in this Undergraduate Catalog. Clinical Experiences may consist of the following: observation (including field trips), tutoring, non-instructional assisting, small group instruction, whole class instruction, work with clinic client(s), and professional meetings.
Every program has a required set of clinical hours which will be completed in conjunction with specific courses. Of these pre-student teaching clinical hours, 50 hours must be in a diverse setting. Learn more about diverse clinical hours on the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center website. Prior to beginning any clinical experience and student teaching, every teacher candidate must complete a National Criminal Background Check (NCBC) through the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center (56 DeGarmo Hall).  
Student Teaching Requirements
During the student teaching semester, the teacher candidate will be involved with directing the learning of pupils, participating in school and community activities, and assuming full responsibility for a group of learners supervised by a cooperating teacher. Student teaching assignments are made based on the teacher candidate’s area of specialization.
The number of semester hours required for student teaching varies with the teacher candidate’s program of study. The student teaching assignment is completed in the candidate’s major field of study and is the culminating experience in the teacher education program.
The following requirements must be met prior to participation in student teaching.
1. Approval for student teaching by the Director of The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center. This approval will include verification of the following:
Completion of pre-student teaching clinical experiences commensurate with the local, state, and national standards;
An application for student teaching filed in The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center at least 6 months prior to the planned student teaching semester;
Satisfactory completion of prerequisite courses to STT 399. (See University-wide courses);
Meeting all requirements for Gateway 1 - Pre-Student Teaching as stated in the Performance-based Assessment System. All requirements for Admission to Student Teaching must be met by December 15 for student teaching during the spring semester and by July 15 for student teaching during the fall semester.
2. Approval for student teaching will be granted by the candidate’s major department chairperson or school director or designee. This approval may be based on the following criteria that the teacher candidate:
Has demonstrated content knowledge in the student’s major area of study;
Has a grade of C or better in all major coursework (that leads to licensure) and all professional education coursework;
Possesses professional knowledge necessary for performing teaching responsibilities;
Has performed at an acceptable level during the pre-student teaching clinical experiences;
Shows evidence of professional characteristics and interpersonal skills necessary for working with children and youth; and
Has completed all other departmental or school requirements, including a minimum major GPA (see major department or school for additional requirements).
Student Teaching Assignments
The University will assign student teachers to selected schools or professional development schools (PDS) in Illinois during regular semesters. Personnel of The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center, in cooperation with the major department or school, secure the student teaching placement(s). Teacher candidates may not self-place and are responsible for their own living arrangements and transportation to and from the student teaching location. Student teachers are assigned only to classrooms that have regularly employed full time and fully qualified teachers. Assignments are not made to a school in which the teacher candidate or a family member is currently or has been employed. 
During the student teaching semester, the teacher candidate works with one or more cooperating teachers who are responsible for teaching a specific group or groups of pupils. These cooperating teachers, along with the University supervisors, have responsibility for guiding and evaluating the work of the student teachers. During this experience, the student teacher becomes a member of the school staff and the community in which they are working. Any student teacher who is unable to continue their student teaching assignment should consult with the Director of the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center immediately. Any student with a disability who needs a reasonable accommodation to complete their student teaching assignment should contact the Office of Student Access and Accommodation Services as soon as possible at 350 Fell Hall, (309) 438-5853. 
The Director of The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center, upon the recommendation of the University supervisor, chairperson or director of the student’s major department or school administrator, may remove a student from the assignment. A student teacher may be required to do additional coursework, engage in remedial activities, and/or complete an extended or additional student teaching experience until the candidate is sufficiently competent to be recommended for licensure. 
Student teaching assignments begin and end on the dates indicated on the student teacher’s official notice of assignment. The student teacher is expected to follow the calendar of the school in which they are completing their student teaching assignment including vacations and school holidays. Changes in dates involved in an assignment must receive prior permission of the Director of The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center.
To be recommended for licensure, a teacher education candidate must earn a grade of C or better in student teaching to meet all requirements for Gateway 2: Student Teaching.
Graduation Requirement for All Teacher Education Majors
All teacher candidates must graduate with a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 2.50.
Licensure for Persons Who Have Been Convicted of a Crime
Entitlement for licensure is not an automatic procedure. The Undergraduate Evaluation Office will notify the Illinois State Board of Education when an Illinois State University candidate has completed all major degree requirements and all requirements identified in the Performance-Based Assessment System for all teacher education candidates. The Illinois State Board of Education makes the final decision in awarding of a teaching license. Additional considerations may preclude Illinois licensure.
If the answer to any of the statements below is “yes,” the teacher candidate may not be eligible for licensure in the State of Illinois. All statements refer to offenses in Illinois or any other state.
Have you ever had a teaching license or certificate denied, suspended or revoked in any state or country?
Have you failed to file a tax return with the Illinois Department of Revenue, or failed to pay any tax, penalty, or interest owed or any final assessment of same for any tax as required by law administered by that Department that was not subsequently resolved to the Department’s satisfaction?

Have you ever been convicted of any of the following:
Felony
Sex Offense
Drug or narcotic offense
Any other criminal offense in any state or federal court (other than minor traffic violations)
If the teacher candidate answered “yes” to any of the above, they must contact the Director of The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center, 56 DeGarmo Hall, prior to starting Clinical Experiences. 
Complaints Regarding Teacher Education Matters
For information on how to appeal department, college or university decisions regarding admission, retention, evaluation, and licensure relative to Teacher Education, please review the procedures found on the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center website and contact the Director of the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center, 56 DeGarmo Hall. 
All teacher education appeals will be reviewed by the Teacher Education Review Board (TERB)/Council for Teacher Education.

Graduate Certificates
Graduate Certificates
Approved 11/29/01; Revised 2018
Graduate-level certificates are graduate courses of study approved by an academic unit designed to provide professional development and career advancement opportunities, to broaden career options, or to enhance an individual’s skills or education as part of the process of life-long learning. These certificates are not part of degree programs, although courses completed as part of a certificate curriculum could be used in meeting degree requirements, where appropriate.
A non-degree graduate certificate student is one who has been formally admitted by a department or school to a specific course of study leading to a certificate. There are two types of non-degree graduate certificates. 
Post-Baccalaureate Graduate Certificate: Requires a minimum of nine semester hours of graduate courses beyond the baccalaureate degree, but fewer hours than a master’s degree.
Post-Master’s Graduate Certificate: Requires a minimum of 9 semester hours of graduate courses beyond the master’s degree, but fewer hours than a doctoral degree.
Admission
An applicant for a course of study leading to a Graduate or Post-Baccalaureate Certificate must have a bachelor’s degree from a four-year college or university that is accredited by the appropriate regional accrediting association, or its equivalent as determined by the Graduate School. For a Post- Master’s Certificate, the applicant must have a master’s degree from a college or university that is accredited by the appropriate regional accrediting association, or its equivalent as determined by the Graduate School. Applicants must also meet the specific requirements stipulated by the academic unit offering the certificate.
Academic Advisor
A Graduate, Post-Baccalaureate, or Post-Master’s certificate course of study shall have a designated coordinator or director assigned by the academic unit chair that is sponsoring the certificate to advise students and confirm completion of the certificate requirements.
For a complete listing of each certificate program’s graduate coordinator(s) or director(s) please visit Grad.IllinoisState.edu/Faculty/Coordinators. 
GPA Minimum
In order to be awarded the certificate, a student must have a minimum graduate GPA of 3.0 in the set of courses required for the certificate.
Time Limitations
All requirements for a graduate level certificate must be completed within six calendar years, beginning with the date the student first registers as a graduate level certificate student. This limitation applies to enrollment in all graduate coursework for the certificate including work for which transfer credit is allowed. Refer to the time limitation regulation for master’s degrees for additional criteria which would apply.
Transfer of Credit
No more than 40 percent of coursework hours required can be transferred from other accredited institutions to satisfy the certificate requirements.
Additional Requirements and Information
Students must complete the same prerequisites or have the equivalent experiences as graduate degree candidates to enroll in specific courses.
No differentiation in course requirements will exist between graduate certificate courses and graduate degree courses.
Students seeking a graduate level certificate are subject to the academic policies and regulations indicated in this catalog. There will not be university recognition of graduate level certificate completion as part of the degree commencement activities except by agreement of the College whose academic unit sponsors the certificate.
The granting of a graduate level certificate will appear on the University transcript.
Eligibility for Financial Aid, Assistantships, or Fellowships
Certificate students are not eligible for graduate assistantships or fellowships intended for degree- seeking students nor federal financial aid. Graduate tuition waivers are granted at the discretion of the awarding unit.
Use of Courses in Degree Programs
Courses taken as part of a graduate certificate can be counted towards a master’s degree following degree grading criteria if the courses are appropriate for the specific degree program and are taken within an approved time frame.
Admission to a Degree Program: Individuals in a graduate-level certificate program who wish to apply to a degree program will go through the usual admissions process for a master’s degree, using the usual documentation (transcripts, standardized scores, etc.).

Candidates for honors must fulfill the general requirements for participation in the University Honors Program and must be Economics majors with a GPA of 3.30 overall and 3.75 or higher in Economics courses. Students will be expected to complete six hours of coursework designated as honors coursework within the Department of Economics. These could include ECO 101 and ECO 102 honors, or 2 in-course honors at the 200- or 300-level. In-course honors requires individual negotiation with the faculty member teaching the course.
