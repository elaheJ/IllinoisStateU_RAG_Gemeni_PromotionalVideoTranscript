50 Percent Rule
Based on Higher Learning Commission Accreditation requirements, all master’s degree programs require a minimum of 50 percent of the non-thesis credit hours applied to the degree to be 400-level courses or above.
Absence of Student Due to Religious Beliefs
Any student in an institution of higher learning, other than a religious or denominational institution of higher learning, who is unable, because of their religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examination, study, or work requirement and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up the examination, study, or work requirement that they may have missed because of such absence on a particular day; provided that the student notifies the faculty member or instructor well in advance of any anticipated absence or a pending conflict between a scheduled class and the religious observance and provided that the make-up examination, study, or work does not create an unreasonable burden upon the institution. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the student such an opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of their availing themselves of the provisions of this Section.  For more information please see the ISU Policy 1.6 Religious Accommodation Policy available at: 
https://policy.illinoisstate.edu/conduct/1-1-6.shtml.

https://deanofstudents.illinoisstate.edu/conduct/code/academic/
Academic Load
Approved 2/23/95; Updated 9/19/02; edited 2/6/03, 8/7/03
Students are considered full time if they register for 9 or more hours during the fall and spring semesters and 6 or more hours in the summer session. A student may register for no more than 15 hours in the fall and spring semester. In the 12-week summer session the maximum load is 12 semester hours. Fees for Student Health Insurance are automatically assessed for full- time students only. Student fees are assessed on a per hour basis. For graduate students in their final semester or on a 9-12 month internship, who have completed all coursework, and whose culminating experiences include thesis/dissertation or internships related to certification/accreditation, a full-time academic load may consist of at least one hour of thesis/dissertation or professional practice credit. Students who desire the “1 credit hour equals full time” designation must be approved for that designation by their graduate coordinator, who will contact the Graduate School for registration. Fees for Student Health Insurance will automatically be assessed for these students. 
If a student holds an assistantship the academic class load is 9 hours in the fall and spring semesters. A graduate assistant in their last semester of graduate studies who needs fewer than 9 hours to complete the degree must have a Graduate Assistant Course Load Waiver Request approved before the beginning of the last semester by their graduate advisor and by the Graduate School. Graduate assistants taking more than 12 hours must have the approval of their graduate advisor.
Note: Graduate students registering for fewer than 9 hours in fall or spring, or fewer than 6 hours in summer, will not have the insurance fee automatically assessed. Those graduate assistants must apply for the insurance through their student account on My.IllinoisState.edu before the fifteenth calendar day of each semester and the eighth calendar day of the summer session to pay premiums or within 15 days of the assistantship start date.
Applying for Degree/Certificate Completion
Approved 11/6/86, edited 9/5/03
Students must meet all requirements for their curriculum. A graduate student must apply for degree completion before the deadlines for each session as specified by the Graduate School. At the time application is made, the degree completion fee must be paid. Applications for students who fail to meet degree completion requirements for a specific session are cancelled, and the students must reapply for a later session. The application for degree completion is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Students completing a certificate program must complete the application for completion of a non- degree graduate level certificate program available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Auditing Privileges
Approved: 11/6/86
A student may register as an auditor in a class or classes if facilities are available. A class taken under the audit option does not count toward a degree; it does not count toward full-time student status for financial aid and other purposes, nor does it count toward total hours enrolled in determining registration priority. Students auditing a class will be charged all applicable tuition and fees. An auditor is expected to attend regularly. To audit, a student must obtain a Request for Auditor registration form from the Registrar Service Center or download it at Registrar.IllinoisState.edu, request the instructor sign it and return the signed form to the Registrar Service Center.
Commencement
Approved: 12/16/92; updated 4/25/02
Degrees are conferred and diplomas awarded after the close of each semester and summer session. Commencement is held twice each year at the end of each fall and spring semester. Participation is voluntary.
Graduate students who complete degree requirements during the fall semester participate in commencement exercises in December; students who complete degree requirements during the spring semester (masters and doctoral) or at the close of the summer session (master’s only) participate in commencement exercises in May.
Doctoral students who complete degree requirements in the summer session who wish to participate in a commencement exercise may only do so in the following December commencement.
All doctoral students must complete all requirements for the degree to participate in Commencement exercises.
Certificate students do not participate in University commencement ceremonies except by agreement of the College which sponsors the academic unit.
Course Registration
Help with registration may be obtained at Registrar.IllinoisState.edu or the Registrar Service Center, in 107 Moulton Hall, or by calling (309) 438- 2188. For office hours, visit the University Registrar website above. Registration may be accomplished during the advance registration period or the additional registration periods prior to the start of the semester.
Deferred Credit
Approved: 11/6/86
Deferred credit (DE) is always given in research and performance courses leading to a thesis, dissertation or exhibition. Credit (CR) will be given when the student satisfactorily completes all requirements for the program. Deferred credit (DE) is not used in computing the cumulative grade point average.
Deficiencies
Approved: 11/6/86
When an applicant has been accepted, the department/school will indicate any courses that may be required to remove undergraduate deficiencies. The department/school also may specify certain graduate courses which will be required in addition to those listed in the catalog and will designate which, if any, of these courses may be used in meeting requirements for the degree.
Degree Audit
A degree audit documents courses, credit hours, grades and other degree requirement specifics. The degree audit is to be completed no later than the beginning of the last semester in which the student is enrolled prior to graduation. The due dates are posted on the Graduate School website. A student cannot graduate without an approved degree audit on file.
Once an option has been approved on the formal degree audit, it can be changed only with approval of the student’s academic advisor. However, when a degree audit is submitted to the Graduate School in the semester of anticipated completion, it can be changed only with written approval of the academic advisor and the Graduate School. The degree audit form is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Disciplinary Hold
A student may not graduate with a disciplinary hold on their record.
Full-time Equivalency
Approved 1/27/21
If a student has completed the maximum requirement of thesis/dissertation hours for the program, but more time is needed, a student may register for a 1 credit of thesis or dissertation for up to two (2) semesters.  This 1 credit course will be counted at a level equivalent to full-time study for the purposes of loan deferment, continued use of university student services, and graduate assistant full-time enrollment eligibility requirements.  An approved PERS 938 (Reduced Course Load Request) is still required for graduate assistants enrolled in this option.
If more time is needed beyond the first two (2) semesters, a formal request for an extension can be made to the graduate school by the thesis/dissertation advisor. Extensions may be approved for a maximum of two (2) additional semesters only if a clear plan for completion has been submitted and only if the student is working at a full-time equivalency on thesis or dissertation work.  Graduate students who are using this extension cannot hold a graduate assistantship.  If the extension is approved, the full-time equivalency could be used for loan deferment or continued use of student services ONLY. 
An extension request must address the following:
An explanation of why the extension is necessary;
If the extension is being requested for one or two semesters;
Explanation of how the student is working at a full-time equivalency on thesis or dissertation work;
A timeline for completion in the requested time-frame; and
Approval of the thesis/dissertation advisor, the graduate coordinator, and the Graduate School.
Use of the 1 credit thesis/dissertation option (or extended period) may also affect the cost of attendance if a student is applying for federal and state financial aid.  Students should consult the Financial Aid department to determine how use of the option will impact the student’s eligibility for federal and state financial aid.

Good Standing
Approved: 12/5/96, revised: 12/10/99, revised: 10/16/2012; edited: 2/17/15, revised: 1/27/21
A student must remain in good standing during the entire enrollment in graduate studies at the University. Good standing includes maintaining a minimum 3.0 graduate cumulative and program GPA to graduate, satisfying any program- specific requirements for good standing, and making satisfactory progress to degree. Students who fail to meet this requirement will either be dismissed from graduate studies or placed on academic probation by the Graduate School.
Note: Campus Solutions calculates cumulative GPA for students pursuing multiple simultaneous programs. It is important individual program GPA’s are calculated manually at the department level to determine each program GPA is a 3.0 or above. Otherwise, the GPA of one program may not be at a 3.0 which is required to graduate. 
Grading System
Approved: 2/15/90; Revised 9/19/02
Instructors assign a letter grade in each course for which the student is registered and are responsible for correcting any error in grading. The grade point equivalents are 4 for A, 3 for B, 2 for C, 1 for D, and 0 for F. Courses completed at this University with grades below C will not count toward a graduate degree or certificate, but all grades of D and F in graduate courses at this University will be included in computing the cumulative grade point average. (See Repetition of Course Requirements section below.) Graduate courses are not available on Passing/Not Passing (P/NP). Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) is provided only where approval through the curricular process has been obtained.
*Spring 2020: Graduate students were eligible for P/NP due to a global pandemic.
Incomplete Grade
An incomplete (I) will be assigned to a student who is doing passing work but finds it impossible, because of reasons beyond their control (such as illness), to complete the required work by the end of the term. The student must have attended class to within three weeks of the close of the semester or to within one week of the close of the summer session. Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the University Registrar. Student will not be allowed to graduate with an incomplete on their record.
After three semesters, an incomplete is automatically changed to an F. A grade change is needed to update the grade after this point in time.
ISU Embargo Policy
Approved: 11/12/19
As a public institution, ISU is committed to public access to all graduate theses/dissertations which reflect the knowledge created through students’ scholarly research and creative activities. The Graduate School requires submission of theses/dissertations to ProQuest/UMI ETD and strongly encourages submission to ISUReD. However, ISU is also committed to students' rights as authors, allowing students to delay access to their theses/dissertations as needed. When an exception to the immediate release of a thesis or dissertation is necessary, an embargo provides a temporary, delayed public release of the work. Embargoes of 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years are available without Graduate School review. When an embargo is granted, the title, abstract, author and program information will be accessible during the restriction period. The embargo periods for ProQuest and ISUReD should be identical lengths of time.
While embargoes are not intended to be permanent, renewals of the original embargo may be considered by the Graduate School. Embargoes longer than 2 years are atypical and require review by the Director of the Graduate School and the Milner Library Copyright Officer. Renewals of embargoes should be submitted to the Graduate School within 1 month of the expiration of the current embargo. Embargos extended beyond 2 years are rarely granted and only done so in extremely compelling situations.
The request to embargo must be approved by the student’s committee chair and submitted to the Graduate School no later than the Right to Defend deadline. An embargo is requested by sending an email to the ISU Copyright Officer.
An embargo past 2 years may be considered for the following reasons:
Patentable rights are contained in the work and disclosure may be detrimental to the rights or interests of the author. The ISU Intellectual Property & Export Control Officer should be contacted by the committee chair as part of the embargo request.
To protect the copyright potential of creative works such as first serial or book rights, a documentary, music score, artwork, etc.
There is a need to prevent disclosure of government information about persons, institutions, technologies, etc. that is contained in the work.
An academic or commercial press has expressed interest in acquiring the rights to publish the work as a book.
The work contains content that has already been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal that may require an embargo. Check publishers’ policies before submitting the thesis/dissertation.
The work is based on data generated through research that will support other publications from people within the same research team (i.e. advisor). As a result, it may be necessary to refrain from releasing that data while other publications are prepared. An additional 2 years may be requested in this situation.
Making the research publicly available might endanger research subjects or the author.
Research and/or data is subject to review by sponsor or grantor prior to publication
Research falling within policy 4.1.13 Classified Research.

New Start Policy
Approved 3/23/89, revised 12/9/99, updated 1/27/21
Students who leave an Illinois State graduate degree program and return to Illinois State may begin the same or new degree program with a new graduate GPA calculated from the point of their readmission to the Graduate School as long as (1) the student is admissible to the new graduate program at Illinois State and meets all the criteria established by the Graduate School; (2) the student has not enrolled at Illinois State University for a period of at least three years; and (3) the New Start provision is approved by the new department or school at the time of readmission.
Students may transfer up to 9 credit hours from another university or previous Illinois State coursework if they meet the requirements outlined on the Transfer of Credit form. Students may exercise the “New Start” option only once and must follow the re-entry catalog. Such students will have “New Start” indicated on their transcript.
Probation
A student may be placed on probation for no more than 3 consecutive enrollment terms, at the discretion of the department/school following each term. A student who fails to return to good standing after each term will be considered for dismissal or placed on another term of probation. A student must be in good academic standing to be admitted to candidacy for a degree, as well as to graduate. Graduate students may not hold a graduate assistantship after one term of probation if the student is not in good standing.
Procedure for Appeal of Dismissal from a Graduate Program
Approved 10/29/19
Students who are dismissed from a graduate program should follow the appeal procedure outlined in the dismissal letter (summarized below). If a student is dismissed from more than one program at the same time they must appeal each dismissal separately.
To appeal a dismissal from their graduate program, a student must submit a written letter to the College Dean or designee within 5 business days from the date of the dismissal letter. The written appeal letter should clearly outline the reason for the appeal, the facts and circumstances leading to the dismissal, and a written plan with benchmarks to continue successfully in the graduate program.
Upon receipt of the appeal, the College Dean or designee will notify the School Director/Department Chair that issued the dismissal, Graduate Program Coordinator, registrar’s office, and Director of the Graduate School. The student, graduate program coordinator, and/or any other individuals that may be of assistance in the review of the appeal can be interviewed or asked to provide further written information. The intention of this step in the process is to be thorough, but timely with a response.
The student will maintain course enrollment until a decision on the appeal is reached.
After considering all available information, the College Dean will provide a written response to the student on the decision of the appeal.
If the dismissal is upheld, the student will be dropped from enrolled courses and become inactive.
If the dismissal is overturned, the student will remain in the program and any required benchmarks for continued enrollment will be communicated in writing.
Repetition of Course(s)
Approved 10/10/02; Revised by Academic Senate 12/10/03; Edited 3/19/04; Edited 5/1/06; edited 9/27/23
If a student completes a course or drops a course after the tenth day of classes receiving a grade of WX, the student may repeat that course once. Undergraduate students who are requesting a third enrollment must obtain permission from the undergraduate academic advisor. Graduate students will obtain permission from the graduate advisor/coordinator who will submit a Third Enrollment Override/Permission Request to the Registrar Service Center to allow the student to register in the course.
When a course has been repeated at Illinois State University, the most recent grade (A, B, C, D, or F) that the student earns will replace the previous grade in the cumulative GPA calculation. A grade of WX, AU, I, CR, CT, NC, P, NP will not replace the grade, nor the hours earned in the prior attempt. The previous grade(s) will not be removed from the student’s transcript, and the credit hours and grade points from only the last graded attempt (A, B, C, D, or F) will be used toward meeting degree requirements. Grades received for repeated courses at another college or university, will not replace the previous grade earned at ISU nor can it be used to improve the cumulative grade point average. However, the transfer credit may be used to satisfy a prerequisite, program, or other requirement at ISU. Courses that allow multiple enrollments have a separate grade recorded for each enrollment and each grade (A, B, C, D, or F) is counted toward the student's GPA. Previous grades are not replaced or removed from the student’s record until the maximum allowable enrollments or credit hours for the course has been exceeded. An Illinois State student considering repeating or enrolling in any classes, including extension or correspondence courses, at another college or university while enrolled at or pursuing a degree from Illinois State University should consult with their advisor. Students repeating a course to improve their GPA should be aware that many professional and graduate schools recalculate GPAs to include all courses attempted. This regulation does not apply to general courses (See Limitation of Credit for General Courses section).
Transfer of Degree Programs
A transfer from one degree program to another requires approval by the receiving and departing department or school and a formal application to the new program. Admission must be received from the department or school student wishes to transfer prior to withdrawal from current program. 
Undergraduates Taking Graduate Coursework for Graduate Credit
Approved 2/15/90, edited 10/16/06, revised 2/10/21
Undergraduates can take graduate courses for graduate credit if they (1) have junior or senior status, and (2) have a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or higher. Total registration cannot exceed 15 hours in that semester. Graduate coursework will not be calculated in the undergraduate GPA. The transcript will indicate the grade received, the number of credit hours the course was worth, but 0 hours earned. This is due to only earned hours are calculated in the GPA. This is common transcript language used by Registrar/Bursar offices. There is no guarantee graduate courses taken will be accepted by another University as transfer credit.
All coursework taken for graduate credit must be approved by the department or school advisor and the Graduate School BEFORE registration. A form titled, "Undergraduate taking Graduate Credit" is available electronically in My.IllinoisState to be completed for approval.
Up to 12 hours of coursework will count toward an ISU graduate degree program only and has a limit of 6 years to be used. Coursework taken for graduate credit cannot count toward a bachelor's degree except under the provisions of integrated bachelor’s/master’s degree and accelerated master’s degree programs. This opportunity is also extended to last semester seniors of other universities who find it possible to take graduate work at this University while completing requirements for the bachelor's degree on their own campuses. Interested students should write to the Graduate School for further information. Such graduate courses cannot be used in meeting bachelor’s degree requirements on their own campuses.

Academic Advisement Report: The Academic Advisement Report is an assessment of the undergraduate student’s academic progress toward completion of requirements for the bachelor’s degree. This report may be viewed on the Academic Requirements on My.IllinoisState.edu. To determine specific program requirements (in addition to the  general requirements for graduation stated above), students should  consult the following sections of the Undergraduate Catalog: (1) the  General Education requirements; (2) the specific requirements for the major and minor fields of study; and, if the student seeks teacher  licensure, (3) the University‐wide Teacher Education program  requirements in this Undergraduate Catalog.
Academic Affairs: One of the four major divisions of the University, headed by the Vice President and Provost, that focuses on educational needs of students.
Academic Good Standing: A minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00, which is required for continued enrollment in the University.
Academic Programs:
Major: A cohesive combination of courses, including introductory, intermediate, and advanced coursework that designates a student’s primary area of specialization. Majors are designated on university transcripts. In Campus Solutions (student information system) a major is referred to as a 'plan'. 
Minor: A combination of courses designed to provide a cohesive introduction to an area of study beyond the major. Minors are designated on university transcripts upon receipt of degree.
Sequence: A subdivision of a major/minor in which there are specific requirements. Sequences of the same major or minor generally share a common core within a major or minor. Sequences are designated on university transcripts upon receipt of degree. In Campus Solutions (student information system) a sequence is referred to as a 'sub-plan'. 
Certificate: 
Undergraduate certificates are a group of courses focusing on a specific area of knowledge or competency designed to provide professional development and career advancement opportunities, to broaden career options, or to enhance an individual's skills or education as part of the process of life-long learning. These certificates are not part of degree programs, although courses completed as part of a certificate curriculum could be used in meeting degree requirements, where appropriate. Undergraduate Certificates require a minimum of 9 credit hours and a maximum of 17 credit hours. Certificate programs should be designed for students who are not in a major/minor in which the certificate resides. However, there may be exceptions. Certificates should not duplicate major/minor requirements. 
Concentration: A subdivision of a major without specific requirements that is provided for advisement only. Concentrations are not designated on university transcripts. All informal curricular recommendations made by departments and schools (such as emphases, tracks, areas of study, specializations, etc.) should be considered concentrations. Concentrations are advisory only; no approval process is required.
Academic Year: The period of time commencing with the fall semester (16 weeks) and continuing through the spring semester (16 weeks) and summer term (12 weeks).
Advanced Placement Program:  Sponsored by the College Board, this program allows students to be awarded credit or exemptions from required courses based on test scores.
Alumni: Individuals who have attended or graduated from a particular college or university.
Audit: The completion of a course taken without credit. It does not count toward full-time student status for financial aid and other purposes.
Board of Trustees: The governing body for Illinois State University.
Campus Solutions: Student Information System software that supports registration and managing students’ progress toward their degrees.
Career: Campus Solutions term for undergraduate or graduate status.
Clinical Experience: Part of a program that allows for observation, participation, studies of individual pupils or clients, individual field work, and practicums both on and off campus.
College Level Examinations Program (CLEP):  A program that allows students to receive credit by examination rather than completing coursework.
Courses:
The University operates on semesters. The credit value of all courses is stated in terms of semester hours. University's Credit Hour Policy 
Students should consult the Course Finder website for course descriptions, prerequisites, and course offerings and My.IllinoisState.edu for class availability. The registration system will enforce prerequisites in effect at the time of registration. Questions regarding course offerings should be referred to the department chairperson or school director. 
Course numbering and terms used in course descriptions
Combination Courses: Course format that combines lecture and laboratory components in each class meeting.
Directed Research: Course format used for independent study, thesis, and dissertation courses.
Independent Study: Intensive study in a special area of the student’s interest under the direction of a qualified member of the faculty. Each individual investigation is to culminate in a comprehensive written report and/or examination and/or artistic project. A maximum of six semester hours of independent study may be applied toward graduation.
Professional Practice: Professional Practice consists of one or more credit-generating, academic/career related, salaried or non-salaried work experiences. Professional Practice work sites are located on the Illinois State University campus and with business, industry, government, and other agencies and organizations outside the University. Professional Practice courses are designated by the numbers 198, 298, 398, 498, and 598. A student may count no more than 16 hours of professional practice courses (198, 298, 398) toward graduation.
Seminar: A regular meeting of students, under the guidance of a faculty member, in which each conducts research and exchanges information, problems, and results through informal lectures, reports, and discussions.
Temporary Course: Temporary courses are active for one year and may not be required for a major, sequence, minor or a certificate. Temporary courses are often used to take advantage of the skills of a faculty member who will be at the University for a limited period, or to respond to particular interests of students. Temporary courses are designated by the numbers 189, 289, 389, 489, and 589. 
Course Modality: Refer to the Office of the Registrar's website for definitions. 
Credit Hour: A standard unit of measuring coursework; credit hours are assigned to a particular course and count toward graduation, except in remedial courses. Typically a course that meets for three hours a week is worth three credit hours.
Cross-listed Course: Cross-listed courses are offered by more than one department or school, but treated as one course for credit purposes. A cross-listed course will be considered as one course regardless of the department/school through which the student registered for the course. This is a general rule that applies to all cross-listed courses taken for any purpose.
Curriculum: A program of study covering the entire undergraduate or graduate career and designed to satisfy the requirements for a degree.
Dean: The highest administrative officer of a college.
Dean of Students: 
Through a variety of services, solutions, and support, the Dean of Students Office helps students apply what they learn in the classroom to real-life practice. The Dean of Students Office also serves as a student support network by providing advocacy, problem resolution, and crisis intervention for those times when additional support is needed. 
Department Chairperson: An administrative officer holding faculty rank; responsible for the primary unit of academic organization.
Enrollment Status: Undergraduate students for fall and spring are considered full-time if they are enrolled 12.0 or more semester hours, half-time if they are enrolled fewer than 12.0 but at least 6.0 semester hours, and part-time if they are enrolled fewer than 6.0 semester hours. Undergraduate students for summer are considered full-time if they are enrolled 6.0 or more semester hours, half-time if they are enrolled fewer than 6.0 but at least 3.0 semester hours, and part-time if they are enrolled fewer than 3.0 semester hours.
Escrow Credit: The practice of holding the placement of courses until the successful completion of specified courses. For example, diploma school or Associate Degree nursing courses are “held in escrow” for the student until successful completion of three specified Nursing upper-division courses at Illinois State University.
Finance and Planning: One of the four major divisions of the University, headed by the Vice President for Finance and Planning, that focuses on financial management and planning.
General Education Program: Thirty-nine credit hours of integrated foundation courses that must be completed to obtain a baccalaureate degree.
Grade Point Average (GPA): The total number of grade points divided by the total graded semester hours attempted at Illinois State Universit
Hold: A block that may prevent a student from receiving a service or performing an action. For example, a financial hold may result in a student not being allowed to register or receive a transcript. Campus Solutions refers to a hold as a “negative service indicator.”
Honors Program: A program designed to serve the needs of academically talented, high-achieving students. 
Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI): A statewide agreement among more than 100 public and selected private institutions, designed to facilitate transfer between colleges and universities within the state. 
Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE): The board that oversees and coordinates all public higher education in Illinois.
Interdisciplinary: A program or course that spans two or more academic disciplines.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct.

    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) Program (Transferrable General Education Package) 
Illinois Articulation Initiative Program
Transferring General Education Courses
The Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) is a statewide transfer agreement among more than 100 public and private four-year and two-year higher education institutions in Illinois. The agreement is designed to facilitate students transferring between colleges and universities and works best for students who are undecided on the transfer-to institution that will grant their baccalaureate degree. The IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) package consists of 12 to 13 courses (37 to 41 hours of credit) within a five-category designation. All schools participating in IAI agree to accept a completed IAI GECC package in lieu of their own comparable lower-division general education requirements. 
The 
IAI GECC package requirements 
are as follows:
Communication: 3 courses (9 credits)
Humanities and Fine Arts: 3 courses (9 credits)
Mathematics: 1 to 2 courses (3 to 6 credits)
Physical and Life Sciences: 2 courses (7 to 8 credits)
Social and Behavioral Sciences: 3 courses (9 credits)
IAI policy is presented on the IAI website, and Illinois State University’s implementation requirements are below. Students who transfer out of Illinois State will be held to the requirements of their transfer institution.
General Education Options for Transferring Students
New transfer students have the option of completing either Illinois State’s General Education program or the Illinois Articulation Initiative General Education Core Curriculum (IAI GECC) package.
To be eligible for IAI, at least one transfer course must have been articulated to an IAI General Education Core Curriculum requirement. Transfer students who have satisfactorily completed at least one course within the IAI GECC are allowed to complete this program by enrolling in approved IAI courses at Illinois State University. Students should note, however, that IAI course availability may be limited.
The Illinois Articulation Initiative provides recommendations to participating IAI schools about Advanced Placement Credit. However, each school has the final decision about how to award/give credit for Advance Placement Exams.
CLEP - Illinois State University policies on CLEP credit will be used to meet IAI General Education Core Curriculum requirements.
Waivers in the 
Illinois Articulation Initiative General Education Core Curriculum 
If a student satisfactorily completes the objectives of a General Education Core area but earns fewer hours than required, the remaining hours for that area can be waived. However, students must complete the minimum of 12 courses, 37 hours, and the number of courses required in each area of the Core. Fractional hours can also be waived, but the minimum 37 hour total is still enforced.
For those students eligible to complete the Core, a transfer course articulated as an Illinois State University course approved for the IAI General Education Core Curriculum package will be applied toward the Core. Any course from a participating school approved by an IAI curriculum panel may be applied even if not articulated to an Illinois State course. Acceptance and placement of transfer credit as an elective from a non-participating IAI institution is only applicable to meet IAI GECC package requirements at Illinois State University. Students should consult their academic advisor regarding the application for waivers.
Effective May 1999, a student transferring to another institution, who has completed at least 37 semester hours, may request an audit, via a transcript request, of his or her records for completion of the IAI General Education Core Curriculum package. 
Students transferring to Illinois State are required to fulfill all University graduation requirements.
Illinois Articulation Initiative Course Requirements
Regardless of category placement, a student may count no more than two courses from a single discipline to fulfill the General Education Core Curriculum requirements. Only one course assigned to an IAI course number may be used to fulfill a requirement (For example, since HIS 104A01 and HIS 104A03 both carry the IAI number of H2 903N, only one may be used). 
Illinois State University courses approved for the IAI General Education Core Curriculum package are listed officially on the IAI website. The following list of courses is provided for convenience only. Some courses may have been added or deleted since the publication of this catalog.
D: Designates IAI courses designed specifically to examine aspects of human diversity within the United States. 
N: Designates IAI courses designed specifically to examine aspects of human diversity from a non-U.S./non-European perspective. These courses satisfy the AMALI graduation requirement at Illinois State University.  
*Western Civilization (H2 901 or S2 902 and H2 902 or S2 903) and American/U.S. History (H2 904 or S2 900 or S2 901) can be used in the IAI category approved by the college or university offering the course or in the category in which the articulated course equivalent was approved at the receiving institution.
12 to 13 courses (37 to 41 hours of credit) 
Communication (3 courses, 9 hours) 
A grade of C or better required in C1 900, ENG 101, and C1 901R, ENG 145. For students with appropriate preparation, Illinois State will waive C1 900. A minimum of 12 courses and 37 semester hours is still required.

Admission/Retention Requirements
						Admission Requirements: Students may declare a major in the School of Social Work upon admission to the University or with permission of the School.
All Social Work majors must also be formally admitted to the BSW program. The BSW Program admission process typically occurs during the fall semester sophomore year and is a prerequisite for taking any 300-level Social Work course. Students are required to complete the formal BSW Program admissions process before their enrollment in SWK 222, SWK 223, SWK 325, SWK 326, and SWK 310.
To be accepted, students must have satisfied the following requirements:
At least 30 hours of credit with a minimum 2.50 overall GPA
Grade of C or better in all required SWK courses
12 hours required in an introductory social work course and liberal arts courses: SWK 170; PSY 110, PSY 350; SOC 106.
General Education courses must be completed prior to admission to the BSW program. Academic credit for life experience and/or previous work experience is not given, in whole or in part, in lieu of any Social Work course.
Exceptions are granted upon the recommendations of the Social Work Admission Committee and the Director or designee of the Social Work program.
Illinois State University School of Social Work completes criminal background checks for all BSW candidates and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic record and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon successfully completing and passing a national background check. The school may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to the BSW program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some field instruction placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the MSW/BSW degree. Many agencies require criminal background checks as a condition for accepting a placement in their program. It is the student’s responsibility to inquire with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to the BSW program, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the School of Social Work. Students must meet the criteria for professional and ethical behavior as set forth by the School of Social Work.
NOTE: The School of Social Work reserves the right to maintain a balanced enrollment. This may restrict the numbers of freshmen, transfer students, and internal transfers who wish to be Social Work majors.
Most Social Work courses are restricted to Social Work majors with the exception of SWK electives.
The School does not offer a minor in Social Work.
Only Social Work students may take required courses.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

Master of Science in Chemistry Program
Master of Science in Chemistry Education Program
Master of Chemistry Education Program
Master of Science in Chemistry Program
Degree Offered: M.S.
The program is broad-based, and allows students to specialize in any of the sub-disciplines (physical, organic, inorganic, analytical, biochemistry, or chemical education), although coursework is required in at least four sub-disciplines. The Master of Science in Chemistry (M.S.) is a thesis-based M.S. degree requiring 31 credit hours including: Four hours each in CHE 490 (Research) and CHE 499 (Master's Thesis) are required as part of the 31-hour program, although most students will register for more than the total of eight required hours while pursuing the degree. Students select a research advisor and work closely with that faculty member to complete a thesis based upon original research. Upon completion of a written thesis, a final oral examination/thesis defense is required.
In general, students admitted to the Master of Science in Chemistry program should have completed coursework in science and math equivalent to that required for a B.S. degree in Chemistry at Illinois State University or have received an American Chemical Society-certified B.S. degree from another school. If a student will be admitted to the Master's degree program with deficiencies (though no student will be admitted with 12 or more credit hours of deficiencies in Chemistry coursework), the deficiencies will be identified as specific courses and students will have to complete those courses as early as possible in order to bring their background coursework to the required level. All deficiencies should be completed by the end of the third semester in the program. In general, credit earned for completion of deficiencies does not apply toward M.S. degree requirements unless the student petitions the Department and receives approval to count specific courses (up to a maximum of six credit hours) for graduate credit in the student's plan of study, and only courses listed as approved for graduate credit on Course Finder may be counted.
This 31-hour degree requires: 
21 hours of 400 and/or CHE 300-level courses including a minimum of 12 credit hours of courses at the 400 level in 3 sub-disciplines (analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, biochemistry, and chemical education)
2 hours: 1 hour each CHE 492 and CHE 494
8 hours: 4 hours each in CHE 490 and CHE 499
Successful completion of a thesis based upon original research and oral examination/thesis defense Graduate coursework in related disciplines may be substituted with consent of the Chemistry Department.
Master of Science in Chemistry Education Program

Students can then apply to the Creative Technologies graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Creative Technologies graduate program.

Effective fall of 2017, the University will also provide a report that includes information on campus sexual violence impacting the University community as required by the Illinois Preventing Sexual Violence in Higher Education Act. 
The Annual Security Report and Fire Safety is available on the Campus Safety and Security website at: Security.IllinoisState.edu. If you have any questions or would like to request a paper copy of the report, please contact the Illinois State University Police Department at (309) 438-8631.

Facility and Space Use
University Housing Services
University Housing Services
Including Watterson, Cardinal Court, Hewett, Manchester, Haynie, Wright, Wilkins Buildings.
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University’s mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by University Housing Services. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as “facilities and grounds”.) These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, challenge, and learn.
The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.
Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University Housing Services with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location where activities may create safety or health risks.
When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
Scheduling and Using Facilities for University Housing Services
Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve space, in public areas in Hewett, Manchester, Watterson Towers, Cardinal Court, Wilkins, Wright and Haynie Residential spaces, please fill out a Facility Request Form.
For any questions regarding scheduling or facility use in these spaces, please call:
Watterson Towers: (309) 438-0549
Tri-Towers (Wilkins, Wright, Haynie Halls): (309) 438-0639
East Campus (Hewett and Manchester Halls): (309) 438-6038
Cardinal Court: (309) 438-0639
Costs Incurred
The University establishes fee rates for use of University facilities and spaces based on the relationship between the University and the person or organization using the facility. Rental rates may vary depending on whether the individual or organization is considered an RSO, a University organization, an Alumni organization, the public, or a nonprofit charitable organization.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
Administration and Procedural Application
Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Coordinator of Events will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security, staff, insurance requirements, and related loss prevention measures.) Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, including but not limited to:
Priority Use of the facility will be given to University Housing Services staff, University Housing Services Organizations, Registered Student Organizations, study groups. Groups with a higher priority may override a reservation.
51% of attendees must be residents of University Housing Services.
Anticipated attendance, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, and entry fee or registration charge.
The person making the room reservation must be a member of the Registered Student Organization for which they are making the request.
Noise that could be generated from the event and the impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity or residents in adjacent locations.
Impact on traffic and parking.
Adequacy and suitability requested to the location.
Event history, time of the activity, performer history, first time event.
Set-up or clean-up needs, and equipment requested.
Compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies.
Potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others.
Presence of minor, food or beverages, animals, media, or technology needs.
Any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section.
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-serve basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Coordinator of Events will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the Vice President for Student Affairs or designee.
Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
University Housing Services will review the event details, assess the event, and determine what measures or requirements are necessary.  University Housing Services must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed.
If certain risks are associated with the proposed event, the following offices may make recommendations to University Housing Services:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events.
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Emergency Management Plan if necessary.
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
University Housing Services recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
Staffing levels may be adjusted, as necessary, based on changing conditions/needs. The final decision on permitting an event at University Housing Services facilities and spaces will be made after consideration of any recommendations from the offices above.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, set-up costs, staffing charges, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
Food on Campus
Food, beverage, and/or catering is not permitted within University Housing facilities unless pre-authorized to do so in writing. A Food Permit may be required as stated in the University Policy on Sale/Distribution of Food on Campus.
Verification of food permit will be submitted to University Housing Services by the client at least seven (7) business days prior to the event. If not received, no food will be permitted.
Events Involving Minors
If the proposed event or activity will involve minors, the sponsor or group must complete the University Program/Activities Involving Minors registration and comply with the University Protection of Minors Policy.
The registration form will be reviewed and must be approved by the Minors Activity Committee in advance of the event. This confirmation should be sent to University Housing Services.
Solicitation and Sales
Promotion or sales of merchandise is prohibited in University Housing Services facilities. An exception may be made for events with written pre-authorization from University Housing Services. Requests for an exemption should be made no less than seven (7) business days prior to the event or activity.
Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associated with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall “hosting” of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building.
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University’s institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its programs without written authorization.
Violations or Non-Compliance Behavior
Violation of this policy could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including but not limited to the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods. Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSO’s) will be handled through the Student Code of Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office. Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources. Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

All master's degree programs require a minimum of 50 percent of the non-thesis credit hours applied to the degree to be 400-level courses or above.
Academic Advisors
An advisory committee will be assigned upon admission. The School Director, in consultation with the student and faculty whom the Director deems appropriate, will select the candidate's portfolio committee. The portfolio committee chair must come from the student's studio area.
Transfer Credit
A student who does not have an earned master's degree usually may present no more than six semester hours of credit from another college or university for use in meeting the requirements of the M.F.A. degree. However, a student may present all earned hours from an M.A./M.S. program in Theatre Studies at Illinois State University for use in meeting these requirements.
The total hours required for a student with an earned master's degree will be based on an evaluation of the student's portfolio and academic record. However, the final determination will not be made until the student has completed a minimum of six semester hours in his/her major area of emphasis. The student's M.F.A. committee will supervise all evaluations. Refer to M.F.A. Transfer Credit in the Fields of Study and Degrees Granted section.
A minimum of 32 hours must be taken at Illinois State University
Residency Requirement
A student without an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least four semesters with at least two of them being full-time, consecutive semesters. A student with an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least two full-time, consecutive semesters. Summer session may be counted toward the two consecutive semester requirement.
The M.F.A. Portfolio
Each semester of enrollment the M.F.A. candidate will enroll in THE 501, M.F.A. Portfolio, for one hour credit. The portfolio is the backbone of the Master of Fine Arts program. It is designed to ensure the regular and systematic evaluation of the student's progress. The portfolio is a collection of materials, including examples of the student's work where appropriate, reviews, evaluations and other artifacts, which may record or characterize the student's experience in the program. The portfolio also contains the student's responses to evaluations as well as statements from the Portfolio Committee which provide direction for the student's future work in the program.
The student must have a portfolio evaluation for each full semester he or she is in the program. The written results of that evaluation are included in the portfolio. The portfolio provides a cumulative record of the student's progress which is carried over from semester to semester.
Finally, the portfolio, with its record of the student's activities in the program, provides the major objective basis for awarding the degree. Although the student may engage in major creative projects during his or her program, the portfolio stands in lieu of the traditional thesis or creative thesis project which is the culminating experience in many programs.
Qualifying/Comprehensive Examination
A qualifying examination is required prior to the exit portfolio presentation. It may be comprehensive to the extent that it examines the candidate's knowledge of the discipline of theatre; it may include graduate work the student is presenting for the degree; and it may include demonstration of proficiency. The examination will be conducted by the student's M.F.A. Portfolio Committee. The student may request that other faculty members with whom he/she has taken course work participate in the qualifying examination.
Final Portfolio Review and Exit Interview
To be eligible for the exit portfolio presentation, the student must (1) present a grade average of B or better with not more than six (6) hours of a grade of C; (2) have completed (or will complete in the current semester) two semesters of full-time resident study; (3) have a degree audit on file with the Graduate School; (4) have passed a qualifying examination; and (5) pass a final portfolio review and exit to be conducted by his/her M.F.A. Committee. The format of this review and exit will be determined by the M.F.A. Committee, who will, when the work is deemed satisfactory, recommend the student to the appropriate studio area for graduation. At least one week before the Graduate School graduation notification deadline, the School Graduate Faculty will meet to hear the studio area's recommendations. Once the Graduate Faculty has approved the student's graduation, the student will be recommended to the Graduate School for the granting of the degree.
Students should consult with their M.F.A. Portfolio Committees and the School Graduate Advisor for details and the calendar of the final portfolio review and exit. While no student is guaranteed graduation, those whose work is deemed unsatisfactory may be presented opportunities for remediation by their Portfolio Committees.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

Applicants are considered on the basis of their academic record and other performance requirements determined by the individual programs. These may include minimum GPAs, minimum scores on the GRE, GMAT or other standardized exams, personal statements or interviews, examples of work, or letters of recommendation.
In order to be admitted to Illinois State as a graduate student, a student must have earned a four-year bachelor's degree or its equivalent from a college or university that is accredited by the appropriate regional accrediting association. Some doctoral or certificate programs may require a master's degree.
Applying to Multiple Programs in One Academic Year 
If applying for a graduate program with multiple sequence options, all applicants are required to select one program sequence at the time of their application submission. Applying for multiple sequences within a graduate program is not permitted. However, you may add an additional sequence to your program of study after successful completion of your first semester of the graduate program with program coordinator approval. Applicants may apply for multiple graduate programs if desired, provided a unique application is submitted for each individual program. This intention must be communicated to the Graduate School prior to any application submissions. Application fees for graduate programs are non-refundable.
Transcripts
Application review
Applicants must present unofficial transcripts from each college or university other than Illinois State at which graduate, undergraduate, or non-degree credit was earned. The unofficial transcript should be easily readable and clearly indicate degree(s) awarded, courses and course grades for each term.
Current or former Illinois State students do not need to send ISU transcripts. However, you may need to provide transcripts from all other colleges attended.
Transcripts can be uploaded to the application for admissions. If sending official electronic or mailed transcripts, we recommend sending your transcripts after you've submitted your application to better match your transcripts with your file.
If you had a previous name or have a questions about a transcript showing up on your to-do list, reach out to the appropriate office:

Application Fee
All applicants are required to submit a nonrefundable application fee or documentation for an application fee waiver. Your application will not be processed until the application fee or fee waiver verification is received. Due to the Declaration of Finances required, international applicants are not eligible for an application fee waiver. This fee or waiver must be received by the program's deadline.
Learn more about the fee or waiver documentation.
Enrollment Deposit Fee
A non-refundable enrollment deposit fee (EDF) of $150 will be required for all new graduate students prior to course registration or the issue of immigration documents. Students will only pay the enrollment deposit one time. Any student enrolling in multiple or additional programs, or needing to defer to a future semester, will not have to pay a subsequent enrollment deposit. Please refer to this webpage for more information on how to pay your EDF.
Additional Requirements
Master's students
In addition to the overall Graduate School requirements above, an individual applying to a master's program must also have a minimum 2.8 GPA (on a scale in which an A is a 4.0) for the last 60 hours of undergraduate work (approximately the junior and senior years).
Many graduate programs require a higher GPA or may require the GRE or GMAT.
Specialist students
In addition to the overall Graduate School requirements above, an individual applying for a specialist program must also have a minimum 3.0 GPA (on a scale in which an A is a 4.0) for the last 60 hours of undergraduate work (approximately the junior and senior years).
Doctoral students (Ph.D., Ed.D)
In addition to the overall Graduate School requirements above, an individual applying to a doctoral program must also:
have earned a master's degree or equivalent in a discipline appropriate to the specific doctoral program
have a minimum 3.0 GPA (on a scale in which an A is a 4.0) for their graduate coursework or in the last 60 hours of undergraduate work (approximately the junior and senior years).
The GRE is not required for admission to all doctoral programs. Check if the GRE is required specifically for admission to your intended program.
Types of Admission
Unconditional Admission 
An unconditional admission generally carries no academic restriction, though you may be expected to take some courses to make up for some undergraduate deficiencies.
Probationary Admission
A probationary admission may be granted to students who don't meet the minimum requirements of the program and the Graduate School but whose academic records demonstrate promise of high achievement. These students will be on probation when admitted and will frequently be given a trial period of one semester to meet specific requirements. Students who meet these requirements within the trial period will be taken off probation and admitted unconditionally; students who don't meet these requirements may be terminated from graduate studies at Illinois State at the end of the trial period.
Conditional Admission
A conditional admission is issued when the application for admission is missing a required official/final document. Most applicants are reviewed with unofficial transcripts or test scores. Admission to the University is contingent upon receiving official or final transcripts with a degree posted and/or official test scores, like GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS, etc. Documents must be sent to the University prior to the start of the term. A student may be terminated from graduate studies at Illinois State if the missing documentation is not provided within one semester.
Undergraduate Taking Graduate Coursework for Graduate Credit
Undergraduates can take graduate courses for graduate credit if they (1) have junior or senior status, (2) have a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or higher. Total registration cannot exceed 15 hours in that semester. Graduate coursework will not be calculated in the undergraduate GPA. The transcript will indicate the grade received, the number of credit hours the course was worth, but 0 hours earned. This is due to only earned hours are calculated in the GPA. This is common transcript language used by Registrar/Bursar offices. There is no guarantee graduate courses taken will be accepted by another University as transfer credit.
All coursework taken for graduate credit must be approved by the department or school advisor and the Graduate School BEFORE registration. A form titled, "Undergraduate taking Graduate Credit" is available electronically in My.IllinoisState to be completed by the undergraduate advisor for approval.
Up to 12 hours of coursework will count toward an ISU graduate degree program only and has a limit of 6 years to be used. Coursework taken for graduate credit cannot count toward a bachelor's degree except under the provisions of integrated bachelor’s/master’s degree and accelerated master’s degree programs. This opportunity is also extended to last semester seniors of other universities who find it possible to take graduate work at this University while completing requirements for the bachelor's degree on their own campuses. Such graduate courses cannot be used in meeting bachelor’s degree requirements on their own campuses.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Admission to the English major may be affected and restricted by the lack of available Department resources in times of oversubscription. Students in the major and all sequences must pass ENG 100 with a C or better in order to advance and complete the program. 
For information about admission to this program visit the 
University’s Academics website
.
The Accelerated English Education Sequence (AEES) is an Accelerated Master's Degree (AMD) program, which serves as a pathway to the Master's in English Education. This AMD is designed for undergraduate teacher education students who, when they graduate with their undergraduate degree, will pursue employment as secondary English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. Qualifying students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher may apply to the AEES once they have reached junior status. Admission is based on competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures are available on the English Education website and applications are considered on a rotating basis each fall and spring semester. Acceptance into the AEES constitutes acceptance into the MA/MS in English Education. To transfer to graduate-only status after completing the BA in English Education, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the MA/MS in English Education. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing.

The Department of English participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the following minors: African Studies, African-American Studies, Children’s Studies, Civic Engagement and Responsibility, Cognitive Science, Ethnic Studies, European Studies, International Studies, Latin American and Latino/a Studies, Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies, Native American Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and also the Minor in Religious Studies in the Department of Philosophy. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs and Department of Philosophy sections.
Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing. By providing a broad work experience, students not only build their portfolios, but also enter the marketplace with valuable and current skills.

Students seeking admission to the Major in Art must comply with criteria established by the School of Art, including submission of a portfolio of work for review by the School. Students interested in the Art History Sequence will submit a statement explaining their interest in the field, in lieu of the portfolio. Specific requirements for the portfolio and statement may be obtained from the School office.
To graduate with a Major in Art (B.A., B.S.) students must complete all requirements of one of the School of Art’s Sequences: Studio Arts, Graphic Design, Art History, or Teacher Education. They must also earn grades of C or better and maintain a 2.50 GPA in all courses taken in the School of Art, in addition to maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00. Individual sequences may have higher requirements. Courses in the Major may be repeated no more than once for the purpose of attaining the necessary minimum grade. Students may not enroll for the next course in a related series until the minimum grade in the prerequisite course is achieved. Incoming transfer students must retake courses considered equivalents to courses in the Major for which they earned lower than a grade of C. Students who do not meet these criteria will be placed on probation with the School of Art; a student placed on probation more than once will be dropped from the School.
Admission to some Sequences in Art may be restricted by the lack of available School resources, especially in times of oversubscription. 
In times of oversubscription and limitations on resources within the School of Art, some Discipline Areas may require faculty screening of students’ supportive materials before allowing individual students to enroll in the second course in that Discipline.
All Sequences in the Major in Art require successful completion of the Art History Core, the Foundations program appropriate to that sequence, a series of courses specific to the chosen sequence, and electives in Art. Students must complete all Sequence Foundations courses before being permitted to continue in one of the sequences in the Art major; gifted students may be allowed to take 200-level courses in their areas of interest during the freshman year, pending approval of the School. Students must also complete all Art History Core courses before they may enroll in 300-level Art History courses.
Students must make every effort to complete the required Foundations courses in their first three semesters in the program. Under most circumstances students will formally declare intention to enter a particular sequence in the Art major by the second semester of the sophomore year. Students will arrange to participate in screening requirements for their preferred sequence; those not accepted into competitive sequences may be reconsidered the following semester and should consult with appropriate faculty for advice before rescreening. Also in the sophomore year, students will begin enrolling in courses appropriate to their sequence of interest. In the case of the Studio Arts Sequence, this also requires declaring a specific Discipline Area in consultation with the School’s academic advisor.
Students can begin to take Graphic Design courses after they have completed the Art History core and Studio Art Foundation courses. There is no portfolio review for admission but students must have and maintain a major and cumulative 2.50 GPA. Students whose cumulative or major GPA falls below 2.50 will not be allowed to register for Graphic Design courses until the GPA has been raised to a 2.50 or higher. Consult the School of Art for further information on admission and retention in the Graphic Design sequence.
Students will be admitted to the Art History Sequence with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 and grades of B or better in ART 155 and ART 156. See the School of Art office for more information. Students will be allowed to continue in the sequence if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 2.50.
All Art majors planning to become licensed teachers must apply for and be admitted to the University Teacher Education program. Grades of C or better in all Art and Education courses, and a 2.50 cumulative and major GPA are required by the Art Teacher Education Area for admission and retention in the Art Teacher Education sequence. Continuation in the Art Teacher Education Sequence is not automatic. Students’ performance will be evaluated each semester.
The sequence in Teacher Education may also be combined with a sequence in Studio Arts, Graphic Design, or Art History. Pursuing a double sequence may require additional semesters. However, this option is strongly recommended to prepare students for teaching art. Students are also encouraged to take coursework in Urban Education and Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. 
Students may apply to the B.F.A. Degree program beginning in their sophomore year. Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the School of Art for the competitive review that is part of the admission process. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor. Students will be allowed to remain in the program if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 3.00.To graduate with a B.F.A., all Studio Arts sequence students are also required to organize and present a solo exhibition of their work during the final year. This exhibition must be accompanied by a public oral presentation, an exit portfolio and a written supportive statement approved by the student's B.F.A. faculty mentors.
Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program with a Sequence in Graphic Design must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the Graphic Design faculty for a competitive review. If a student drops below a 3.00 GPA or fails a required design course, the student will no longer be able to continue in the BFA sequence, but will be able to shift their design studies to the B.A./B.S. degree offering. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor.To graduate with a B.F.A., all Graphic Design sequence students are also required to participate in and help organize a group exhibition with the other B.F.A. Graphic Design students.

Major in Art (B.A., B.S.)
Students in the Art major must complete one of the following sequences.
Studio Arts Sequence
The Studio Arts Sequence emphasizes both breadth and depth of competence in Studio-based Art disciplines. It expands students’ horizons beyond the Foundations level with work in a variety of media and disciplines. By requiring intensive study, it develops depth within at least one Studio Discipline Area (ceramics, drawing, glass, intaglio, lithography, metal­work and jewelry design, painting, photography, sculpture, video, wood/metal or expanded media) through the completion of a specific series of courses. It likewise encourages exploration of new genres that break through traditional boundaries between disciplines and media. This sequence prepares students to work as visual arts professionals or pursue graduate studies.

In addition, students may gain professional experience in a graphic design internship. Internships will require a competitive portfolio review.
View Graphic Design Sequence Course Requirements
Art History Sequence
The Art History Sequence provides students a solid grounding in the history of art on both introductory and advanced levels. In addition, the sequence includes exposure to related disciplines outside the visual arts, training in foreign language, and experience in advanced research and writing skills. Together, these requirements prepare students for effective graduate work in Art History or other fields and for positions in a variety of art- and non-art-related fields. 
In special circumstances, students may satisfy the Art History language requirement with a language or languages other than “French, German, Italian or Spanish.” In such cases, the language(s) must be appropriate to the student’s plan of study and career goals. Alternate plans of language study must be approved by the Art History faculty in order to receive credit toward the sequence.
It is recommended that students select electives in courses related to Art History offered by the following departments/schools: Anthropology; English; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; History; Music; Philosophy; Theatre and Dance. Students are encouraged to consult with the Art History faculty for advice on choosing electives in Art History and other departments that will complement their own areas of interests. Faculty are also available for consultation on preparing for graduate school.
Students may combine Art History and Studio by declaring a second Sequence in Studio Arts and fulfilling all requirements for both sequences. This will include submitting a portfolio of art work for admission.
View Art History Sequence Course Requirements
Art Teacher Education Sequence
The Art Teacher Education Sequence is a program that emphasizes a comprehensive approach that supports state and national student learning standards and teaching performance standards in the visual arts. Also stressed are creative and critical thinking, studio techniques, understanding the learner and developing skills to become an effective teacher. Students completing this sequence are eligible to apply for teaching licensure with a K-12 endorsement for teaching art in the State of Illinois.

Admissions Information
Illinois State University’s Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders completes criminal background checks for all candidates for the Master’s Program in Speech-Language Pathology and the Doctoral Program in Audiology and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic records, and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon completing and passing a national background check. The department may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to a CSD graduate program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some clinical placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the advanced degree. Many clinical sites require criminal background checks for accepting a student clinician in their setting. It is the student’s responsibility to inquire with the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to a graduate program in CSD, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders. Students must meet the professional and ethical standards set forth by the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders.
In addition to the requirements of the Graduate School, the degree students must meet all the academic requirements and clinical practicum requirements for the Certificate of Clinical Competence of the American Speech-LanguageHearing Association. Copies of requirements for both Illinois and national certification 
can be found online. The graduate programs are accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation.
Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.00 in major courses and overall to retain their degree status and to be eligible for department clinicals. Enrollment by graduate students in the department's clinicals requires degree status. In all instances, permission of the Clinic Director is needed for practicum enrollment, and enrollments may be restricted. External graduate clinicals may require special coursework and will require a student to provide transportation to external settings arranged by the department.
A candidate for the master's degree must 
complete two external placements
 in order to qualify for the degree. A degree student in the Doctor of Audiology program must spend one year in residency in order to qualify for the degree. A year in residence is interpreted as three consecutive semesters
 of enrollment in CSD 598.90 for one credit hour each semester.

Illinois State accepts a maximum of:
70 semester hours from a two-year institution
90 semester hours from a four-year institution, OR
combined total of 90 hours from two-year and four-year institutions

Please see A.S. degree information on the Transfer Requirements page.

Our Transfer Guides show you how specific courses transfer to Illinois State from your Illinois community college.
Watch Transfer Guides Video
iTransfer helps students transferring between colleges and universities in Illinois with general education coursework, known as the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI).
Watch iTransfer Video
Transferology is a nationwide, online evaluation tool to help you find course equivalencies at participating institutions (throughout the U.S.).
Watch Transferology Video
Additional Information
Illinois State University operates on a semester calendar, so hours taken at an institution following a quarter or other calendar will be converted to semester hours.
Transfer credit is evaluated and placed according to the course numbering system from the transfer institution.
Credit from a community college is not recognized as senior college level credit.
Transfer students begin with a new GPA because only credit hours transfer; grades are not transferable.
Illinois State University participates in the State of Illinois Reverse Transfer of Credit initiative which helps students who have enrolled at an Illinois community college to complete an associate degree. Read more about Illinois State's reverse transfer process.

Honors in History
Honors work in the Department of History has been designed to offer to qualified undergraduates the opportunity to develop an independent, individualized program of study while working closely with departmental faculty in the field of their special interest. Students who complete the requirements will graduate with Departmental Honors, which will be noted on their transcript and diploma.
Honors Admissions Requirements
To be admitted to the Honors Program, stu­dents must: (1) be members of the University Honors Program, and (2) have completed 45 hours, at least nine hours in history with a minimum GPA of 3.50 in History. Recom­mendation of at least one member of the departmental faculty is required as is the approval of the Departmental Honors Advi­sor. Students may also be invited to apply by a faculty member. In specific cases these requirements may be waived but only with the express approval of the Departmental Honors Advisor and the History Department Chairperson.
Honors Study Requirements
In order to graduate with distinction as a Departmental Honors Scholar in the Department of History, the student must complete (1) at least 6 hours of Honors work in the major - HON/HIS 299, HIS 301 (which require pre-approval from the Departmental Honors Advisor), (2) all university graduation requirements, (3) all regular requirements for the major, and (4) all University Honors requirements as outlined in the catalog. The Departmental Honors Advisor and the History Department Chairperson will regularly evaluate students in the program. Any student whose work does not meet the minimal standards of the program will not be allowed to continue.
For more information on Honors in History, including admission and retention standards, please visit the Honors website.

Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of History participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors and one interdisciplinary major at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the Major in European Studies and the following minors: African-American Studies; African Studies; Classical Studies; European Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies; Native American Studies; Urban Studies; and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Program section.
Major in History
Admission to the History major, including the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, may be restricted by the lack of available Department resources.
The Department of History encourages stu­dents seeking a bachelor’s degree to develop both global and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of history and to apply these methods to their studies in other disciplines. To develop their skills in historical analysis and to learn to think critically about histori­cal accounts, students complete HIS 100, HIS 200, and HIS 300. To acquire both a well-rounded and a global understanding of historical processes, students are required to take 6 hours each in the 3 fields of European, non-Western, and United States History.
The Department of History recognizes the value of language to the study of history from a global perspective. For this reason, the department recommends that all students majoring in history complete a Bachelor of Arts program. Those students majoring in history but choosing to pursue a Bachelor of Sciences program must complete a minor program.
Students in the History major must complete one of the following sequences.
General History Sequence
B.A. students are encouraged to improve their career opportunities by minoring in another discipline. B.A. students not opting for a minor must choose an area of concentration by taking a minimum of 9 hours in any field other than history or foreign language; at least 3 of these hours must be in 200- or 300-level courses. B.A. students are encouraged to continue their language studies beyond the 12 hours required by the Bachelor of Arts.
B.A. and B.S. students in either the History (non-teaching) or History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence must complete HIS 100 during their freshman year as History majors and should complete HIS 200 before enrolling in any 300-level History course. HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen. Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor. HIS 300 is a capstone course to be taken in the student’s last full semester on campus. For students in the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, this would be the semester just prior to student teaching.
6 hours of non-Western History listed in group 3 of “History Courses by Group for the Major.” At least one of the non-Western electives must be at the senior level.
HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen, Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor.
B.A. students are encouraged to complete a minor; but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than history or foreign language, with at least 3 hours at the 200-or 300-level.
B.S. students must also complete a minor.
View General History Sequence Course Requirements
General History Accelerated Sequence
High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate programs in History. Students can then apply to the History graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the History graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the History Department advisor.

The Master of Athletic Training (MAT) degree is a 52 credit hour program and requires both classroom and clinical education. Admission to the academic program is limited and is based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Specific undergraduate prerequisite coursework is required for admission. For a complete list of prerequisite coursework, please refer to the MAT website.
Once admitted, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 on a 4.00 scale throughout the entirety of the program. A student falling below the GPA requirement will be placed on probation for one semester and removed from clinical education. If after one semester the minimum GPA has not been re-established, the student will be dismissed from the program.

Admissions Information
Illinois State University School of Social Work completes criminal background checks for all BSW and MSW candidates and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic record and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon successfully completing and passing a national background check. The school may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to the MSW/BSW program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some field instruction placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the MSW/BSW degree. Many agencies require criminal background checks as a condition for accepting a placement in their program. It is the student's responsibility to inquire with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to the MSW/BSW program, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the School of Social Work. Students must meet the criteria for professional and ethical behavior as set forth by the School of Social Work.
A 60-hour, two-year program for fulltime students, students may also choose part-time programs and should consult with the advisor. New students who have undergraduate degrees in fields other than social work or from non-accredited schools of social work complete the full program. Students with undergraduate social work degrees from programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education may be given advanced standing and complete the 30-hour advanced curriculum.
NOTE: Academic credit for life experience and/or previous work experience is not given, in whole or in part, in lieu of any social work course.

Graduate Certificate in Social Aspects of Aging
A multidisciplinary program designed to offer a limited number of academically and professionally oriented graduate experiences in aging. The graduate certificate is located within the Department of Sociology and Anthropology in cooperation with the Departments of Family and Consumer Sciences, Psychology, Health Sciences, the School of Social Work, and Communication Sciences and Disorders. Please consult this Graduate Catalog and the program coordinator in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology for details.
Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Graduate Certificate
For Social Work Students
The WGSS graduate certificate sequence offer students a conceptual vocabulary for recognizing the intricacies of power and teaches them to identify the barriers that hold social inequalities in place. The sequence’s intersectional approach to social issues increases cultural competency by providing practitioners with a working social justice conceptual toolkit that is easily integrated in their professional work.
This 12-hour graduate certificate encourages social work practitioners not only to understand more fully the daily obstacles their clients face, but also to empower their clients by providing them with the skills they need to succeed. Please consult this Graduate Catalog and the WGSS program advisor for details.
Post-MSW Professional Educator License Graduate Certificate
Interested students who have previously completed a master's in social work degree but wish to obtain a professional educator license with a "school social worker endorsement" from the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) may complete the required coursework and a school social work practicum placement. The program is offered part-time over 2 years; the first year consisting solely of coursework and the second year consisting of a 700 hour practicum placement in a school setting with a school social worker and a concurrent seminar course. During the program, students also complete the required social work "content exam" and reading modules, which allows them to be eligible to apply for and obtain licensure from ISBE upon completion of the certificate program. Thus, when all course and field practicum requirements are met, students submit their application to ISBE to receive their "professional educator license (PEL) with a school social work endorsement".
17 total hours are required
3.0 cumulative GPA is required
The required courses must be completed with grades of "C" or better (with the exception of field-related courses, which require a grade of “B” or better or Credit, if graded on a Credit/No Credit scale).

Admission to this academic program is limited and is based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: courses completed, cumulative GPA, hours completed, personal interview or written statement, and samples of work completed. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
The Department of Criminal Justice Sciences reserves the right to maintain a balanced enrollment.
This may restrict the numbers of freshmen, transfer students, and continuing students who wish to be Criminal Justice Sciences majors.
Most Criminal Justice Sciences courses are restricted to Criminal Justice Sciences majors.
Criminal Justice Sciences majors must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.40 every semester. If, at any given time, a student’s GPA falls below a 2.40 that student may be removed from the major and reclassified as Undeclared.

Requirements
Transfer Student Admission Requirements
Illinois State University is a leading destination for transfer students in Illinois. With 30 percent of our students transferring from other colleges and universities, Illinois State is known for being a transfer-friendly institution.
Many programs have required and recommended courses and minimum GPA requirements, in addition to the University Requirements listed below.
Transferring Credit
Transfer Admission Guide
Majors
Due to space limitations and the competitiveness of the applicant pool, it may not be possible to offer admission to all qualified applicants. Highest admission priority will be granted to transfer students with the strongest academic records. Earning an associate's degree does not guarantee admission.
Transfer students with a minimum 2.4 GPA may be admitted to the University as undeclared if program prerequisites were not met or if space is not available in the preferred major. Students with 75 or more semester hours completed will not be admitted as undeclared.
University Requirements
What Admissions considers:
Official college transcript from each college or university attended (cumulative college GPA)
Prerequisite college coursework, for some academic programs
Good academic standing at the last college attended
Optional personal statement
Other considerations:
If you are a transfer student with fewer than 24 semester hours at the time you apply, you will also need:
High school transcript (cumulative GPA, grade trends, and rigor of courses completed)
Official SAT or ACT scores sent from the testing agency (optional)
GED scores (if non-high school graduate)
Test-takers must score a minimum of 150 on each part of the GED
If all four sections were completed prior to December 31, 2013:
Minimum score of 410 on each of the five tests
Average battery score of 450
Please note: Remedial coursework will not be taken into consideration when calculating the admission GPA or the number of semester hours earned at the time of application.
General Coursework Recommendations
We encourage all transfer students to complete the course equivalents of the following courses before they enroll at Illinois State:
Introductory-level composition (ENG 101)
Intermediate-level composition (ENG 145)
Introductory-level speech (COM 110)
An Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) approved math course (non-remedial, transferable math)
The Associate of Science degree from an Illinois public community college does not require the following courses: one humanities/fine art and one social and behavioral science. If you would like your Associate of Science degree to complete your general education requirements, we recommend completing these two courses at the community college before you transfer. However, these two courses can also be completed while attending Illinois State.
The Associate of Arts degree will fulfill general education requirements automatically.
Many programs have required and recommended courses and minimum GPA requirements, in addition to the University requirements. Please review the program requirements for your intended major before you apply.
Foreign Language Graduation Requirements
It is helpful for transfer students who wish to pursue a major in the College of Arts and Sciences or any Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree to complete foreign language graduation requirements prior to attending Illinois State.
The College of Arts and Sciences requirement may be met by:
Three years of one language in high school, OR
Completion of the second semester (LAN 112) or higher of a college-level foreign language (including American Sign Language) with a grade of C or better.
B.A. candidates must successfully complete three semesters (through LAN 115) OR pass a course proficiency test. These are required for graduation, not admission.
Admitted Transfer Student Profile
Middle 50% ranges for 2021
2.93-3.67 GPA
 Personal Statement
All applicants are welcome to submit a personal statement for review, though it is not required to complete your application. This statement may be considered along with other application materials to determine eligibility for admission. If you opt not to submit a statement and further review is needed to make an admission decision, we will request a personal statement from you at that time.
If you would like to submit a personal statement, your submission should be approximately 500 words in length and address the contributions you are prepared to make to our community, both academically and otherwise. Specifically, your statement should:
Identify any circumstances that affected your academic performance, if applicable
Make clear your commitment to academic success in college, acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses and your plans to utilize available resources
Articulate your readiness to engage productively in our campus community outside the classroom

Facility and Space Use
General Revenue Facilities
General Revenue Facilities
General Revenue Facilities include classroom buildings, Alumni Center, lab schools, and outdoor spaces.
Scheduling of General Revenue facilities for non-academic use is coordinated by the University’s Conference Services. To ensure fulfillment of Illinois State University’s mission relative to teaching, research and service and to offset ongoing equipment, maintenance and janitorial costs, the University assesses user fees for this space. User fees for General Revenue space will be applied to the following categories. Classification of the appropriate category will be made by the Conference Services Non-Academic Scheduling Coordinator.
User Fee Rate Classification
Public
“Public” refers to a person or public organization not affiliated with Illinois State University. Public events would occur if the event is not sponsored by a University Department as part of official University business, by a Registered Student Organization currently registered with the Student Involvement Center, or by a Faculty/Staff member serving in a professional capacity such as a member of a professional organization which is educational in nature and directly related to the mission of the University.
University Organizations
“University Organization” means Illinois State University department/school/unit, college, division, or University-related organization. University organization events are those sponsored by a University Department as part of official University business, by a Registered Student Organization currently registered with the Student Involvement Center, or by a Faculty/Staff member serving in a professional capacity such as a member of a professional organization which is educational in nature and directly related to the mission of the University.
Notes
A University Department, Registered Student Organization, or Faculty/Staff member serving in a professional capacity (such as a member of a professional organization which is educational in nature and directly related to the mission of the University), who sponsors an event where an entry fee, admission fee, registration fee, voluntary donation for admission, or any other type of income collected or accepted at the event or in advance, will be assessed an on-campus user fee. If a fee, admission, or income is not collected, there would be no user fee assessed.
Reservation Information
The availability of facilities may be verified by calling Conference Services (438-2403). A Facility Request form must be completed with waiver signature, and completion of the minors policy to confirm the reservation. Reservations for facilities and outdoor spaces are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. The consideration of requests is made after academic scheduling is completed. Therefore, Facility Requests for Summer and Fall semesters may be submitted in advance but will not be considered until around February 1. Facility Requests for Spring semester may be submitted in advance but will not be considered until around September 1. A fully completed Facility Request form is required to be returned to Conference Services at least ten (10) working days prior to event. Requests received less than ten (10) working days prior to event will not be considered. Reservations are not considered final until a confirmation email is returned to the applicant. The University reserves the right to determine and/or limit space assignments for scheduled events.
Conference Services will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security, staff, insurance requirements, and related loss prevention measures. 
Risk assessment factors may include but are not limited to: anticipated attendance, venue capacity, street closures/traffic impacts; whether the event is designed to include minors; whether the event involves the serving of alcoholic beverages, public safety permits, third party vendors, or public safety officers; whether the event involves the use of fireworks/pyrotechnic devices, temporary structures, or modification to the infrastructure of the venue. Parties reserving facilities will be informed of terms and conditions of use, including potential insurance requirements or need for security, before a reservation is finalized.
If certain risks are associated with the proposed event or activity, the following offices may make recommendations to Conference Services as necessary.
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events.
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Emergency Management Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Conference Services recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
Conference Services may adjust staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event or activity shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up cost, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the Provost or designee.
Unscheduled Expressive Events
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas (Quad, Milner Plaza, People’s Park, Stevenson Plaza, Redbird Plaza, etc.) of the campus controlled or scheduled by Conference Services with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas.
Cancellation, No Show, Deposit
The organization must contact the Conference Services Scheduling Coordinator regarding cancellations. 
A cancellation fee of 50% of room rental will be assessed with less than 30 days of notice. A cancellation fee of 100% of room rental will be assessed with less than 10 days of notice. The organization/sponsor will also be assessed charges for labor, requested equipment, or other costs incurred by the University for the canceled event.
The University, at its discretion, may require organizations to post a partial or full advance payment/deposit when the facility is reserved, or at least ten (10) days in advance of the event. The deposit will be returned to the User if the facility is left in good condition following the event or will be returned to the User if notice of the event cancellation is received 30 days in advance of the event.
Billing
After the completion of the event, Conference Services will provide the User an invoice listing the user fees. Some events which require supervisory services may be invoiced separately by other departments. The User will pay the University for all unpaid invoices within 30 days after date of invoice. Accounts not paid in full within 30 days will be subject to 1 1/2 % interest per month and the User will waive the right to future space or equipment use. The User will be invoiced according to the original Facility Request form. Therefore, the user must notify the Scheduling Coordinator of any changes to the original Facility Request form at least five (5) working days in advance of the event. The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred, but not limited to, clean-up, special construction, set-up, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
University Rights and Regulations
Events with signed contracts or letters of agreement entered into between the University and the event sponsor will be honored. However, many University requirements, such as scheduled instruction and officially sponsored meetings, are sometimes not known when a request for University space is made. Therefore, the University reserves the right to re-locate events to comparable space when necessary, no less than ten (10) working days in advance of the event. 
Special Information About Metcalf Laboratory School and University High School
When school is in session, the University reserves the right to re-locate events to comparable space when necessary, or to cancel the reservation if the space is required for official University use no less than five (5) working days in advance of the event. Although the Lab Schools are included in the General Revenue Space inventory, they are first and foremost an elementary school and a high school. As such, they have extracurricular, after school and related activities unique to their educational purposes during the school year. These events include scheduled instruction, officially sponsored meetings, and athletic and post-season tournaments in which the schools are a participant.
The University requires users to provide Conference Services with event entry forms, registration forms, brochures and/or other advertising materials used to promote the event in advance for approval.
The University may exercise the right to enter any room for the purpose of inspection, repair, or emergency.
The User is required to adhere to all University policies, regulations, guidelines, and all local, state and federal laws. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in denial of future use of University facilities and services.
If a User provides false or misleading information, the University has the right to refuse future use of University facilities.
In addition to these guidelines, the University expects the individual or organization using General Revenue facilities to comply with any additional policies and regulations of the specific facility. Registered Student Organizations need to also comply with any additional policies and regulations as determined by the Dean of Students Office.
If the proposed event or activity involves minors, the sponsor or group must complete the University Program/Activity Involving Minors online application available at the Environmental Health and Safety website. This form will be reviewed and must be approved by the Minors Activity Committee in advance of the event. This confirmation should be sent to Conference Services.
The University may permit exceptions to these guidelines and may develop additional guidelines as appropriate.
Indemnity and Damages
The User shall assume full responsibility for the conduct of all participants attending the User’s event. As such, the User is liable for all damages resulting from participant utilization of the facilities and equipment provided by the University. The User will reimburse the University for all damages to facilities and equipment, including audio-visual equipment, including repair or replacement, resulting from the use of those facilities and equipment by the User and/or its participants. The University assumes no responsibility for loss or theft of personal property, or damage to personal property of the User or any of its participants. The User shall indemnify and hold harmless the University, its offices and employees, against any and all claims for loss, injury or damage to persons or property arising out of activities conducted by the User or its guests on or in University facilities. The University assumes no liability whatsoever for any property placed by the User in University facilities.
Insurance
User shall procure and maintain Commercial General Liability (including contractually liability) in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 annual aggregate. Sexual abuse/molestation shall not be excluded.
If alcohol will be served, User shall procure and maintain applicable liquor liability insurance, and assure that those that serve alcoholic beverages have completed TIPS/BASSET training.
All insurance carriers must have an A.M. Best rating of B+ or better and a financial rating of VI or better for Commercial General Liability and Liquor Liability insurance.
Evidence of insured coverage should be delivered to: Non-Academic Scheduling Coordinator, Conference Services, Illinois State University, Campus Box 8610, Normal, IL 61790-8610 at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the scheduled event. If such evidence is not received within ten (10) days prior to the event, the event may be subject to cancellation.
Safety and Supervision
Attendance at any event is limited to the fixed seating of the room or the established capacity in rooms where seats are not used. Standing in the aisles and behind seats during any program is prohibited except for those staffing the event.
Exits must be open and accessible at all times. No required exit door may be fastened so that the door cannot be opened from inside by use of the door handle or by pressure on the crash bar. Exit ways serving the room must always be adequately lighted when the room is occupied.
All materials used as decorations must be fire resistant or flame-proof. Nothing may be attached to windows, walls, drapes, posts, or furnishings without prior approval from the Scheduling Coordinator. Open flames are prohibited in all indoor facilities! Open flame requests for outdoor venues will be reviewed by Grounds and Environmental Health and Safety. 
Supervisory personnel for events requiring a supervisor, lifeguard, or technician will be assigned by the Conference Services Scheduling Coordinator and scheduled by either the Scheduling Coordinator, Recreation Services, or Classroom Technology and Learning Spaces. Costs for supervisory personnel will be paid by the user and are in addition to the user fee.  
The approval of the Facility Request is dependent upon the availability of the supervisory personnel.
Alcoholic beverages are not allowed in General Revenue space. Any violation will result in denial of future use of University facilities.
Smoking
Illinois State University is designated as a smoke-free campus. See Policy 5.1.7.
These guidelines apply to General Revenue Facilities. Inquiry should be made to the appropriate facility director for regulations and policies regarding other facilities.
Violation of the procedure could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including but not limited to the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods. Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) will be handled through the Code of Student Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office. Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources. Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

Using the Catalog
Using the Undergraduate Catalog
The statements in this catalog are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as the basis of a contract between a student and Illinois State University. The course offerings and requirements of the University are continually under review and revision. Information regarding courses may be found on the Course Finder website or by contacting the academic unit. It is especially important that each student note that it is his or her responsibility to be aware of current graduation requirements for a particular degree program.
Undergraduate Catalog Requirements
All students are assigned the Undergraduate Catalog year associated with their term of admission to Illinois State University. If attendance is not continuous, the student does not attend at least one term of each academic year, a student must meet the requirements specified in the Undergraduate Catalog in effect when he or she reenters the University. If such a student continues in the curriculum chosen originally, the hours earned in meeting the requirements of the original program may typically apply to the hour requirement of a revised program. In some rapidly advancing fields, students may be required to repeat courses where content has changed significantly. 
In all instances, the University may adjust graduation requirements to ensure that each graduate of a teacher preparation curriculum meets the course requirements for an Illinois Teaching License.
Advisors may request that a student be placed into an earlier catalog, up to two years prior to the assigned catalog, if it is in the student’s best interest. University programs are constantly evaluated and improved, a student may graduate under new requirements published while he or she is in attendance at the University. If a student changes catalog year, the student must meet all the requirements, including General Education and graduation requirements, in that catalog.
A catalog year begins the first day of summer session and ends the last day of the spring semester. 
Students are encouraged to review the following sections of this catalog:

The MBA degree assumes an undergraduate knowledge base in business and economics which students with undergraduate degrees in business will normally have acquired.
Students admitted with nonbusiness undergraduate degrees may have to complete Pre-MBA Program courses before enrolling in the MBA core courses. Specific requirements will be determined by the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Curriculum (hereafter referred to as "Associate Dean"). The responsibility for demonstrating prior academic coverage of the material at the appropriate level rests with the student and should be completed at least one month prior to the beginning of the first semester of course work. Students who have not taken college algebra, economics, accounting, finance, and/or statistics within the past five years are strongly encouraged to take the Pre-MBA Program courses as a refresher prior to their first core course.
Students with a non-business undergraduate degree should expect to complete some or all of the following Pre-MBA Program courses online. 
Fundamentals of Economics 
Financial Accounting
Managerial Accounting 
Principles of Management 
Principles of Marketing 
Business Math and Statistics 
Understanding Corporate Finance 
Business Law Essentials
In addition to any Pre-MBA Program courses required, some or all of which may be waived based on an individual's previous academic work, all MBA candidates must complete one of the following sequences:
Traditional MBA Sequence
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416 
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450; Students who have successfully completed 12 or more undergraduate semester hours in a required core area may be eligible to substitute a 400-level elective in that area for the required core course. 
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485 
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. (Graduate courses at the 300-level may not be taken to fulfill the MBA elective requirements). In consultation with a Master of Business Administration advisor, students can choose from among a wide offering of elective courses to design a Plan of Study. The choice should be congruent with each student's goals. Elective courses are offered based on student demand. Elective courses taken outside the College of Business require prior approval by the Associate Dean and often involve additional course work to fulfill prerequisites.
Corporate MBA Sequence (CMBA)
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. The CMBA is a cohort program. Students vote to choose which three electives the cohort will take.

Required Credit Hours: 36
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416

3 hour capstone course: MBA 485

Course Limitations
No more than a total of three (3) credits can be counted from any 400 (Independent Study) and 498 (Internship) courses. Exceptions must be approved by the Associate Dean. Credit will not be given for course numbers below 400 (no 300-level graduate course will be counted in a Traditional or Corporate MBA Plan of Study). All core and elective courses must be completed within six years from the time of taking the first core course.
Credit-Hour Limitations for Non-Business Graduate Students
While other graduate programs on campus may require and/or give elective credit for selected MBA courses, non-MBA graduate students will not be permitted to exceed 12 credit hours of MBA course work. Non-business students seeking to enroll in MBA courses will first need to obtain their major advisor’s permission to register for classes and then must submit to the MBA Office an online override request form. Permission to enroll is dependent upon space availability in the requested course(s) and prior completion of prerequisites. MBA students will have priority in registration.
Courses
Descriptions of courses leading to the MBA degree are found under the Departments of Finance, Insurance and Law; Management; Marketing; Accounting; and Master of Business Administration.
Repetition of Courses in the MBA Program
A student may register officially for an MBA course (core or elective) only twice. A student who completes a course or drops a course after census day (the tenth day of the semester) may officially enroll in the same course only one additional time.

Financial Aid
Financial Aid
Students who attend the University may be eligible to receive financial aid in the form of loans, scholarships, tuition waivers, grants and employment. In addition to funds received through gift aid and loans, many Illinois State students seek employment to help cover expenses.
Students interested in applying for financial assistance may contact the Financial Aid Office.
All students are encouraged to apply for financial aid by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This application determines eligibility for state, federal and institutional financial aid, including federal student loans.
Undocumented students who are not eligible for federal financial aid and not eligible to complete the FAFSA may complete the Alternative Application for Illinois Financial Aid to be considered for state and institutional financial aid.
Financial aid counselors are available Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. In addition, you may access information on the Financial Aid Office website.
Institutional and Financial Assistance Information for Students
The law (the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, and regulation 34 CFR 668) requires Illinois State University to notify enrolled students and the parents of dependent enrolled students annually of the availability of the following information:
your rights under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act;
your right to a deferment of repayment of your Federal Direct Loan for Peace Corps or volunteer service;
financial aid available at Illinois State University;
information about Illinois State University;
the graduation rate of degree-seeking, full-time undergraduate students at Illinois State University;
an annual campus security report; and,
a report on athletic program participation and financial support data.
General Eligibility Criteria
To qualify for federal or state financial aid programs, you must:  
be a United States citizen or be an eligible non-citizen;
submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to the federal processor;
be enrolled for a minimum of 6 hours (half-time status) per semester (Students not pursuing a degree or unclassified students are not eligible for financial aid, including loans.); not be in default on a Perkins Loan or any federally guaranteed loan;
not owe a repayment to a federal grant program; and
make satisfactory progress toward a degree as defined by Illinois State University (See Satisfactory Academic Progress)
NOTE: Generally a student may not receive federal or state financial aid from more than one institution at the same time.
Application Procedures
To be considered for financial aid at Illinois State University, you must complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), or the Renewal FAFSA, based on the following time table:  
In September renewal aid applicants will be sent an email notification for FAFSA on the Web if they provided a valid email address on the current year’s FAFSA.
In October Complete the FAFSA online 
Typically the priority FAFSA filing date for Illinois State University is November 15 each year. The federal processor must receive your application by this date to ensure your application receives full consideration for all financial aid programs. Due to a federal delay in the release of the FAFSA application for 2024-2025, the Illinois State University priority filing date has been extended to April 1. If your FAFSA is received after the priority date, you will be considered for financial aid programs for which you are eligible and that have remaining funds.
The income and asset information provided on the FAFSA determines your financial aid eligibility. Be sure to use Illinois State's Title IV school code: 001692. There is no separate institutional application for financial aid at Illinois State. You will need to submit an additional application for summer aid (see Financial Aid for Summer Session).
Financial Aid for the Summer Session
If you are enrolled for at least six hours of coursework, you may apply for financial aid.  The application form for the Summer Session will be available in the Forms and Publications section of the website in early March.
Data from your FAFSA will be used to determine your eligibility for aid for the summer session. Aid funds for the summer session are very limited. Direct Loan funds are available only if you have remaining loan eligibility for your class level.
Verification
The Department of Education’s regulations require the Financial Aid Office to verify the accuracy of financial data for some aid applicants. We call this process “verification.” If your application is selected for verification, you will be notified via email and asked to provide supporting documentation. A list of requested items will also be posted to your “To-Do List” in your Student Service Center. Responding to our requests for documentation in a timely fashion is important to avoid delays in processing your financial aid offer notice and/or disbursing your financial aid.
Types of Aid Available
Federal grants and benefits
 - Federal grants and benefits are considered “gift-aid” and typically do not need to be repaid.
Scholarships
Loans
Financial Aid Disbursement
If your charges exceed your credits, you will have a leftover balance that will need to be paid. If the amount of financial aid exceeds charges, you will receive a refund of the balance.
Satisfactory Progress
Satisfactory academic progress for federal and state financial programs is based on three measures: 
cumulative grade-point average,completion rate based on credit hours completed compared to attempted,
and a maximum timeframe for degree completion.
Enrollment Changes and Financial Aid Eligibility
Enrollment Changes and Financial Aid Eligibility
Exit Information
Before you graduate, or if your enrollment status drops below 6 hours per semester, you will be sent information concerning Direct Loan exit counseling, which outlines loan repayment, consolidation, and deferment options.

This sequence of the major is not part of the entitlement program leading to high school mathematics teacher endorsement. All re­quirements are the same as the Mathematics Teacher Education Sequence except for State of Illinois requirement of successful comple­tion of the edTPA.
Actuarial Science Sequence
This sequence of the major is designed to teach the students the mathematical founda­tions of actuarial science, and to prepare them for careers as actuaries in a variety of fields dealing with the risk of potential finan­cial losses, such as life insurance, health in­surance, financial risk management, property/casualty/liability insurance, pensions, or employee benefits.
View Actuarial Science Sequence Course Requirements
Statistics Sequence
This sequence of the major is designed to prepare students for statistical work in industry and government. In addition to learning the mathematical foundation in statistics, students study at least two cognate areas of application of statistics from Biometrics, Computer Science, Econometrics, Finance and Psychometrics. This will allow students to experience many fields of statistical applications and select a field of their choice for a career. It is to the advantage of the student to have a minor or double major in one of the above areas. However, it is not a requirement for the sequence.

High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in Creative Technologies. Students can then apply to the Creative Technologies graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Creative Technologies graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the Creative Technologies Program advisor.

120 minimum total credit hours
A minimum of 40 of the 120 total hours must be senior college hours (200-300 level courses)
AMALI requirement (certain courses in General Education and/or major may fulfill the AMALI requirement)

General Education Requirements
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
The first way is to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program (see below for details).

Illinois State University's General Education Program
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours).

Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language. 
For information about admission to this program visit the University’s Academics website.

Earning College Credit in High School
Earning College Credit in High School
There are many ways to earn college credit while you're still in high school.
Dual Credit Courses
Some high schools offer the option of taking community college courses which count for credit at both the high school and college level. If you have done so, be sure to submit your official college transcript. It will be reviewed and credit will be awarded as appropriate.
How to Transfer Credit
How Credit Will Transfer
Advanced Placement (AP) Credit
Advanced Placement (AP) is a program sponsored by the College Board that allows high school students to take accelerated classes that may count for college credit. If you take AP courses and get high enough scores on the official exams, you may be awarded course exemption and/or credit.
Accepted AP Exams and Scores
International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program
Sponsored by International Baccalaureate, the program is designed to prepare students for success in the University and beyond in a variety of subjects. A student who has participated in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme should have his or her scores sent to the University Registrar. Students with the appropriate scores will be awarded proficiency for specific International Baccalaureate Program work as indicated.
Accepted IB Scores and Courses
College Level Examination Program (CLEP)
College Level Examination Program tests are another way to earn course exemption and/or credit toward General Education requirements at Illinois State.
Learn More About CLEP Credit
State Seal of Biliteracy
Illinois State University accepts the State Seal of Biliteracy from any state as equivalent to two semesters (8 credits) of language study (LAN 111-112) in languages offered at the University. If the seal is granted in a language not offered at Illinois State University, eight credit hours of lower division foreign language will be awarded. Students must request course credit for their seal within three academic years after graduating from high school. No credit will be awarded for the State Commendation toward Biliteracy, though students with the commendation are encouraged to determine their level through self-placement exams or proficiency exams.

Admissions Information
The MSBE is a non-licensure degree that assumes an undergraduate knowledge base in business and education which students with undergraduate degrees in business education will normally have acquired. Students admitted with a non-business undergraduate degree may have to complete foundation courses before enrolling in any business graduate course. Specific requirements will be determined by the department chair and the program coordinator. The responsibility for demonstrating prior academic coverage of the material at the appropriate level rests with the student and should be completed at least one month prior to the beginning of the first semester of coursework.
Students with a non-business undergraduate degree should expect to complete foundation courses as required to enter courses that have an MBA designation. Foundation courses may not count as part of the MSBE required courses. Some or all of the foundation courses (up to 17 hours) may be waived based on an individual's previous academic work.
Master of Science in Business Education
Degree Offered: M.S.
This 33-hour program requires:  
9 hours required core courses from: MBA 416, MBA 411, MBA 430.
18 hours from Business Education. Students can choose from: BE 422, BE 430, BE 454, BE 462, BE 465, BE 480, BE 482, 
BE 400, BE 401, BE 402, or other courses as approved by department. 
6 hours of electives from MBA courses or MKT 414

Visiting and Non-Degree Seeking Students
Home
Admissions
Visiting Students
Overview
A visiting student is one who does not wish to seek a degree at Illinois State University. This is an "unclassified" status in which the student is not in a degree program.
Typically these are students who are taking classes at Illinois State to transfer them to another institution or taking dual enrollment classes as a high school student. Alternatively, a visiting student may be establishing a GPA at Illinois State in hopes of being admitted to a degree program at a later time.
How to Apply
Students who are in good academic standing at their current college or university are eligible to be visiting students. If the course you wish to take has prerequisites, you must prove that you meet them by submitting an official transcript.
Visiting students may want to determine whether a course will be available prior to applying for admission. Contact the Registrar Service Center at (309) 438-2188 for assistance.
Students who have a bachelor degree must apply as a Visiting Graduate Student.
Start Application
Application Deadlines
Unclassified Status
If you attend Illinois State as a visiting student, you will be considered unclassified, which is different than being admitted to a degree program at the University. Courses you take as an unclassified student count toward your grade point average at Illinois State; however, there is no guarantee the courses you take as an unclassified student will count toward your degree should you be admitted into a degree program in the future.
Visiting students are not eligible for financial aid.
Class Registration
Some courses at Illinois State are only available to students in that major, so we cannot guarantee you will be able to take any course you wish. You can search course offerings through  Course Finder, and we will email you when course registration is available. If you need help registering for undergraduate classes, contact our academic advisors at Advising@IllinoisState.edu or (309) 438-7604. Graduate students can contact the Graduate School at GraduateSchool@IllinoisState.edu or (309) 438-2583..
Transferring Courses
If you wish to transfer the courses you take at Illinois State to another institution, we highly recommend that you consult with your academic advisor at your current institution about course transferability before you sign up for the course. Our Registrar Service Center can provide you or your institution with an official transcript.
Graduate Students
Taking Classes
Only students admitted to Illinois State as a degree student or a visiting student may take graduate classes. You should check to see whether or not the classes you want to take are available to you before submitting a visiting application. Some departments do not permit visiting student enrollment and others, because of limited staffing or physical constraints, restrict access to certain courses to their degree students. Visiting students will need to obtain a course permission/override to be eligible to register for any course at the University.
It is also recommended that you reach out to the Graduate Coordinator overseeing the graduate course you wish to complete.
Using Credits Towards a Degree
Visiting students who later decide to pursue a degree at Illinois State may petition that coursework taken as a visitor be accepted in meeting program requirements. The petition must be recommended by the program and granted by the Graduate School. Normally no more than 12 credit hours of visiting enrollment will be approved toward a degree but, under special circumstances, up to one-half of visiting credit hours may be applied. There is no guarantee or expectation that any coursework taken as a visitor will be accepted toward program degree requirements. All graduate courses taken as a visiting student will be computed into the graduate grade point average.
Connect With Your Program
If you plan to seek a graduate degree, be sure to discuss the pros and cons of visiting enrollment with the graduate coordinator of the program to which you plan to apply.
Visiting graduate students are not degree students and are, therefore, not typically eligible for most forms of financial aid.

International Business Program
Degrees Offered: B.A. and B.S.
Major in International Business
The Baccalaureate program in International Business (BSIB) provides a specialized curriculum for students interested in business focused on the global environment. Graduate’s careers may include working abroad, working for a multinational or working in a globally diverse firm. The BSIB combines coursework in general and international business, foreign language, and area studies. Through specialization in a business area, the BSIB combines coursework in international business and a functional area of business. The required international business courses provide solid exposure to the unique dynamics of international business. Area studies and foreign language requirements further enhance the students' international experience. Study abroad experiences are an essential element of the international business program. It is required that every international business major participate in a study abroad program or complete an international internship unless they receive an exemption from the program director.
The BSIB is divided into a common business core applicable to all business students, the International Business core, a concentration in a functional area, the Languages, Literatures, and Cultures requirement, and area studies requirements. 
Business Study Abroad
The College of Business has partner institutions in various parts of the world including Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Additional partnerships are under development. The College coordinates short term, summer, year long and semester programs as well as international internships. Students should begin exploring study abroad early in their studies but plan to study abroad during their junior year in most cases. Study abroad programs are conducted in English unless the student chooses to study a language while abroad. Beyond the College of Business exchanges, many of the ISU exchanges also offer some business courses. First, explore the ISU Study Abroad website for the current list of College of Business programs and all ISU study abroad opportunities. Second, make an appointment with a Study Abroad Advisor to understand your choices. Third, consult your academic advisor to plan the best time to travel and how to arrange course requirements to maximize your learning abroad. All credits earned abroad transfer back into your degree, but courses taken abroad must be approved to meet course requirements.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

Terms Used in Course Descriptions
The following section explains how to read and use a course description, and the terminology used within course descriptions.
Also offered as: (cross-listed course) the specified courses are identical and are thus considered interchangeable in meeting all requirements. Credit can only be earned in one of the specified courses.
Consent of the instructor: The course instructor must give consent before a student may register for the course.
Formerly offered as: indicates a course previously offered under a different number or title. The course is interchangeable with the previous course number or title.
Materials charge optional: indicates an optional fee charge for course materials.
Multiple enrollments allowed: indicates that a course may be taken for credit more than once if different content is planned; there may be a maximum amount of credit specified for the course.
Not for credit if earned: (course) means that content overlap exists between the specified courses and that students should not be able to count both toward graduation. Such courses are not, however, considered interchangeable in meeting all requirements.
Not for credit toward a graduate degree program: credit from this course may not be applied to the degree program requirements.
Variable credit courses: are those courses leading to differing number of credit hours. A student should plan with the advisor the number of hours to be sought in a variable credit course.
Course Offerings
 Courses: Course format that combines lecture and laboratory components in each class meeting.
Contract: Contract educational services, programs and courses are delivered through mutual contract to a business site for a specific cohort or business entity.
“Decimalized” Course: A course with different subtopics but standard learning outcomes; for example, ENG 409 may examine different topics. Campus Solutions replaces the decimal with the letter A, so ENG 409.01 appears as 409A01.
Directed Research: Course format used for independent study, thesis, and dissertation courses.
Distance Education: A formal education process in which the majority of the instruction occurs when student and instructor are not in the same location at the same time. Instruction may be synchronous or asynchronous.

Course Information
The University operates on the semester plan. The credit value of all courses is stated in terms of semester hours. Ordinarily, a semester hour is assigned for a 50-minute class meeting per week for the semester; therefore, a course valued at three semester hours generally meets three periods weekly. In laboratory courses, at least two 50-minute periods per week are ordinarily required for each semester hour of credit.
In addition to its fall and spring semesters, the University provides a summer session with courses of varying lengths and a variety of short-term offerings.
Course Availability: Some courses listed at CourseFinder.IllinoisState.edu may not be available each year. Questions concerning scheduling of courses should be referred to the department chairperson or school director.
Course prerequisites are listed on Course Finder and may change over time. The registration system will enforce prerequisites in effect at time of registration.
Course Numbering System
Courses are numbered in the following order: course number (3 digits preceding the title), course title and credit value (in semester hours). Following the course description any prerequisites, restrictions on enrollment, and any special considerations are noted.
Each course bears a distinguishing number for identification and indication of its academic level. Courses 300-399 are advanced undergraduate courses and are open to juniors, seniors, and graduate students. 300-level courses approved for graduate credit are noted in Course Finder. To receive graduate credit, students must complete applicable graduate requirements provided in the course syllabus. Courses 400-499 are graduate courses. Courses 500- 599 generally are limited to terminal degree students in programs such as the Ed.D., M.F.A., Au.D., D.N.P., and Ph.D.
The numbering system for advanced courses is as follows:
300-399: Advanced undergraduate courses. Open to juniors, seniors, and sometimes graduate students.
400-499: Courses at this level are for graduate students. With approval from the instructor, the department chair/school director, and the Graduate School, advanced undergraduates may be permitted to enroll in 400-level courses for undergraduate credit only.
500-599: Courses limited to advanced graduate or doctoral students.

Facility and Space Use
Campus Recreation
Campus Recreation
Facilities include Student Fitness Center, McCormick Hall, Gregory Street Fields, the Redbird Adventure Center, and Bowling and Billiards Center.
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University’s mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by Campus Recreation. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as “facilities and grounds”). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, challenge, and learn.
The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.
Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by Campus Recreation with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
Scheduling and Using Facilities for Campus Recreation
Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve space in the Student Fitness Center, McCormick Hall, Gregory Street Fields, or the Redbird Adventure Center, please fill out a Facility Request Form.
For any questions regarding scheduling or facility use in these spaces, please call 309-438-8426.
Costs Incurred
The University establishes fee rates for use of University facilities and spaces based on the relationship between the University and the person or organization using the facility. Rental rates may vary depending on whether the individual or organization is considered a RSO, a University organization, an Alumni organization, the public, or a nonprofit charitable organization.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
Administration and Procedural Application
Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Coordinator of Events will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security, staff, insurance requirements, and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, including but not limited to:
Anticipated attendance, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, and entry fee or registration charge.
Noise that could be generated from the event and the impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity.
Impact on traffic and parking.
Adequacy and suitability requested to the location.
Event history, time of the activity, performer history, first time event.
Set-up or clean-up needs, and equipment requested.
Compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies.
Potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others.
Presence of minor, food or beverages, animals, media, or technology needs.
Any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section.
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-serve basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Coordinator of Events will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the Vice President for Student Affairs or designee.
Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
Campus Recreation will review the event details, assess the event, and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. Campus Recreation must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed.
If certain risks are associated with the proposed event, the following offices may make recommendations to Campus Recreation:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events.
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Emergency Management Plan if necessary.
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Campus Recreation recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
Staffing levels may be adjusted, as necessary, based on changing conditions/needs. The final decision on permitting an event at Campus Recreation facilities and spaces will be made after consideration of any recommendations from the offices above.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, set-up costs, staffing charges, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
Food on Campus
Food, beverage, and/or catering is not permitted within Campus Recreation facilities unless pre-authorized to do so in writing. A Food Permit may be required as stated in the University Policy on Sale/Distribution of Food on Campus.
Verification of food permit will be submitted to Campus Recreation by the client at least 7 business days prior to the event. If not received, no food will be permitted.
Events Involving Minors
If the proposed event or activity will involve minors, the sponsor or group must complete the University Program/Activities Involving Minors registration and comply with the University Protection of Minors Policy.
The registration form will be reviewed and must be approved by the Minors Activity Committee in advance of the event. This confirmation should be sent to the Coordinator of Events and Outreach within Campus Recreation.
Solicitation and Sales
Promotion or sales of merchandise is prohibited in Campus Recreation facilities. An exception may be made for events at Gregory Street Fields with written pre-authorization from Campus Recreation. Requests for an exemption at Gregory Street Fields should be made no less than seven (7) business days prior to the event or activity.
Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall “hosting” of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building.
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University’s institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its programs without written authorization.
Violations or Non-Compliance Behavior
Violation of this policy could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including but not limited to the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods. Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSO’s) will be handled through the Student Code of Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office. Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources. Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

How to Reserve a University Facility or Space
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality Facilities
Event Management, Dining and Hospitality
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality (EMDH). This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as “facilities and grounds”). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn.
The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.
Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by EMDH with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g., a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
Scheduling and Using EMDH Facilities
Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve space in the Bone Student Center or Braden Auditorium, contact Event Services at (309) 438-2222, email at 
EMDH@illinoisstate.edu
, or visit the EMDH website.
Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event cease and desist.
Administration and Procedural Application
Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the event planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (e.g., security staff; Emergency Medical Service personnel; other security; insurance requirements; and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity including, but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, ticketed event or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the event planner will work with the individual or organization sponsoring the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police Department
Environmental Health and Safety
Emergency Management
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality
Risk Management
Office of General Counsel
Additional departments as the need arises
Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The event planner will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The committee will review the event details, assess the event, and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The committee must grant approval to all events referred for review before a reservation is finalized and confirmed.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred including, but not limited to, clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
Illinois State University Police Department recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events.
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Emergency Management Plan if necessary.
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
EMDH recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
Illinois State University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and EMDH may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
Reasons for Delaying or Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying or denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following:
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status.
The request to use space conflicts with a preexisting reservation, other events on campus, or lack of staff availability and no reasonable alternative time or place is available on the date requested.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to Vice President for Student Affairs or their designee.
Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associated with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall “hosting” of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building.
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.
Violations or Non-Compliance Behaviors
Violation of this procedure could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including, but not limited to, the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods. Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) will be handled through the Code of Student Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office. Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources. Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

However, there are a number of optional credentialing opportunities that students are encouraged to examine. Coursework in this major is focused on the content areas needed for certification preparation by several organizations in this professional field of study. Students graduating in this major can strengthen their professional credentials by pursuing a variety of different certifications offered by organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Strength and Conditioning Association. Students interested in learning more about these recommended certification options should consult the Exercise Science Program Director in the School of Kinesiology and Recreation for further information.
Standards for Progress in the Major
Once admitted to either sequence within the Exercise Science major, the student must maintain a minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA. A student falling below the required 2.50 GPA will be placed on probation for one semester. If after one semester the 2.50 GPA has not been re-established, the student will be dropped from the Exercise Science major. A student who has been thus dropped from the Exercise Science major may reapply for admission to the major after raising his or her GPA to the required standard. The student who is not readmitted after one semester of probation and has a minimum 2.00 GPA will have the option of entering the Kinesiology Studies Sequence.
Students in the Exercise Science major must complete one of the following sequences.
Allied Health Professions Sequence
Exercise Science is the study of movement and the associated functional responses and adaptations the body makes as a result of movement/exercise. The Allied Health Professions sequence provides students with a well-rounded foundation in areas of exercise science, including functional anatomy, exercise physiology, biomechanics, sports and exercise psychology, and motor behavior. In addition, the Allied Health Professions sequence requires advanced science course work to prepare students for graduate studies in athletic training, physical therapy, physician's assistant, and other allied health programs.

Shared Governance
Illinois State University takes great pride in shared governance. The University recognizes that for the institution to operate effectively the voices of administrators, faculty, staff, and students need to be heard and that optimal solutions often come from the results of these groups collaborating. University governing bodies – Board of Trustees, Academic Senate, Administrative/Professional Council, Civil Service Council, and Student Government Association—represent the constituencies of the University and form the formal structure for shared governance.
Board of Trustees
The governance of Illinois State University is vested by law in the Board of Trustees. Within the limits set by the State Constitution and the federal and state laws, the Board of Trustees is the final authority in all matters affecting the institution, and it exercises jurisdiction over the institution's financial, educational, and other policies and its relation with the state and federal governments.

Academic Senate
The Academic Senate is the primary governing body that recommends educational policy for the University and advises the President on its implementation. Members of the Academic Senate are elected by their constituencies and include faculty, staff, and students.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Admission to the English major may be affected and restricted by the lack of available Department resources in times of oversubscription. Students in the major and all sequences must pass ENG 100 with a C or better in order to advance and complete the program. 
For information about admission to this program visit the

The Accelerated English Education Sequence (AEES) is an Accelerated Master's Degree (AMD) program, which serves as a pathway to the Master's in English Education. This AMD is designed for undergraduate teacher education students who, when they graduate with their undergraduate degree, will pursue employment as secondary English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. Qualifying students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher may apply to the AEES once they have reached junior status. Admission is based on competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures are available on the English Education website and applications are considered on a rotating basis each fall and spring semester. Acceptance into the AEES constitutes acceptance into the MA/MS in English Education. To transfer to graduate-only status after completing the BA in English Education, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the MA/MS in English Education. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing.

Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the following minors: African Studies, African-American Studies, Children’s Studies, Civic Engagement and Responsibility, Cognitive Science, Ethnic Studies, European Studies, International Studies, Latin American and Latino/a Studies, Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies, Native American Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and also the Minor in Religious Studies in the Department of Philosophy. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs and Department of Philosophy sections.
Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing. By providing a broad work experience, students not only build their portfolios, but also enter the marketplace with valuable and current skills.
View Publishing Studies Sequence Course Requirements
Technical Writing and Rhetorics Sequence

Focusing on this sequence prepares you for a career as a technical and professional writer in a variety of settings, such as corporate, nonprofit, and governmental organizations.

Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by Athletics. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as “facilities and grounds”). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn.
The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.
Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus. Athletic facilities not generally accessible for use by the public are not available for unscheduled expressive activities.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. an athletic facility or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time. 
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
Scheduling and Using Facilities for Athletics
To schedule or reserve space in Redbird Arena, Horton Fieldhouse, Hancock Stadium, Hancock Stadium Club, contact the Athletics Department, Redbird Arena, Room 223, (309) 438-2000, athleticfacilities@illinoisstate.edu. Other Athletic facilities may be scheduled for restricted use. 
Cost Incurred  
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, an Athletic Department official may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, an Athletic Department official may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, an Athletic Department official may ask that the event cease and desist.
Administration and Procedural Application
Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Athletic Department representative will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
impact on athletic scheduled events
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Athletic Department representative will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the Director of Athletics or designee.
Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The Athletic Department representative will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary.  
If certain risks are associated with the proposed event, the following offices may make recommendations to the Athletics Department as necessary.
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Emergency Management Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Athletics recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
Athletics may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs. A final decision will be made after consideration of all recommendations.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
Events Involving Minors
If the proposed event or activity will involve minors, the sponsor or group must complete the University Program/Activities Involving Minors registration and comply with the University Protection of Minors Policy.
This form will be reviewed and must be approved by the Minors Activity Committee in advance of the event. This confirmation should be sent to Hayden Young at 309-438-3630, email at hyoung@illinoisstate.edu, or contact Emily Schierenbeck at 309-438-8353, email at AT_easchi1@illinoisstate.edu.
Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associated with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall “hosting” of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building.  
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.
Violations or Non-Compliance Behaviors
Violation of this procedure could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including but not limited to the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods. Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) will be handled through the Code of Student Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office. Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources. Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

The MBA degree assumes an undergraduate knowledge base in business and economics which students with undergraduate degrees in business will normally have acquired.
Students admitted with nonbusiness undergraduate degrees may have to complete Pre-MBA Program courses before enrolling in the MBA core courses. Specific requirements will be determined by the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Curriculum (hereafter referred to as "Associate Dean"). The responsibility for demonstrating prior academic coverage of the material at the appropriate level rests with the student and should be completed at least one month prior to the beginning of the first semester of course work. Students who have not taken college algebra, economics, accounting, finance, and/or statistics within the past five years are strongly encouraged to take the Pre-MBA Program courses as a refresher prior to their first core course.
Students with a non-business undergraduate degree should expect to complete some or all of the following Pre-MBA Program courses online. 
Fundamentals of Economics 
Financial Accounting
Managerial Accounting 
Principles of Management 
Principles of Marketing 
Business Math and Statistics 
Understanding Corporate Finance 
Business Law Essentials
In addition to any Pre-MBA Program courses required, some or all of which may be waived based on an individual's previous academic work, all MBA candidates must complete one of the following sequences:
Traditional MBA Sequence
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416 
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450; Students who have successfully completed 12 or more undergraduate semester hours in a required core area may be eligible to substitute a 400-level elective in that area for the required core course. 
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485 
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. (Graduate courses at the 300-level may not be taken to fulfill the MBA elective requirements). In consultation with a Master of Business Administration advisor, students can choose from among a wide offering of elective courses to design a Plan of Study. The choice should be congruent with each student's goals. Elective courses are offered based on student demand. Elective courses taken outside the College of Business require prior approval by the Associate Dean and often involve additional course work to fulfill prerequisites.
Corporate MBA Sequence (CMBA)
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. The CMBA is a cohort program. Students vote to choose which three electives the cohort will take.

3 hour capstone course: MBA 485

Course Limitations
No more than a total of three (3) credits can be counted from any 400 (Independent Study) and 498 (Internship) courses. Exceptions must be approved by the Associate Dean. Credit will not be given for course numbers below 400 (no 300-level graduate course will be counted in a Traditional or Corporate MBA Plan of Study). All core and elective courses must be completed within six years from the time of taking the first core course.
Credit-Hour Limitations for Non-Business Graduate Students
While other graduate programs on campus may require and/or give elective credit for selected MBA courses, non-MBA graduate students will not be permitted to exceed 12 credit hours of MBA course work. Non-business students seeking to enroll in MBA courses will first need to obtain their major advisor’s permission to register for classes and then must submit to the MBA Office an online override request form. Permission to enroll is dependent upon space availability in the requested course(s) and prior completion of prerequisites. MBA students will have priority in registration.
Courses
Descriptions of courses leading to the MBA degree are found under the Departments of Finance, Insurance and Law; Management; Marketing; Accounting; and Master of Business Administration.
Repetition of Courses in the MBA Program
A student may register officially for an MBA course (core or elective) only twice. A student who completes a course or drops a course after census day (the tenth day of the semester) may officially enroll in the same course only one additional time.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language. 
For information about admission to this program visit the University’s Academics website.

Notes
A maximum 6 hours of POL 398a01, IDS 398a02 and LGS 398a20 may count toward major.
Accelerated master 's degree (AMD) programs offer high achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor 's degree and master 's degree in a faster time frame than each degree separately. Students will take both graduate and undergraduate classes when they have junior or senior status and seamlessly transition into their master 's degree program. Students admitted into an accelerated master 's degree program may count a maximum of twelve (12) hours or 33% of course work (whichever is higher) towards both the bachelor 's degree and master 's degree. The coursework requires approval of the academic advisor.
Students must complete at least one graduate course as an undergraduate to be considered in the accelerated master’s degree program. If the student does not complete at least one graduate course, or chooses to withdraw from the accelerated program, they will be placed back in their original degree program.

Legal Studies
Degree Offered: B.A., B.S.
Major in Legal Studies
The Legal Studies curriculum is an American Bar Association approved paralegal educational program. It is designed to prepare students for a career as a paralegal in public and private law offices, corporate law departments, and government agencies. Students learn how to communicate effectively with both lawyers and laymen. When acting under an attorney’s supervision, a trained paralegal can perform many law-related tasks although they do not give legal advice to clients, set fees or represent clients in court. Paralegals may not provide legal services directly to the public except as permitted by law.
Admission to the Legal Studies major is limited and based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: courses completed, cumulative GPA, hours completed, personal interview or written statement, and samples of work completed. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission, and the application process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
 In order to gain admission into the Legal Studies minor, a student must have completed at least two (2) Legal Studies courses (one of which must be LGS 201); and must have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 2.50 in those two Legal Studies courses. For further information contact the Department of Politics and Government.
Students in the Legal Studies major must complete one of the following sequences. 
General Legal Studies Sequence

General Education Requirements
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
The first way is to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program (see below for details).

Notes
Enrollment in 200-level business courses requires 45 completed credit hours. Enrollment in 300-level business courses requires 75 completed credit hours.
Courses for the language requirement and area studies requirement are often able to also meet general education requirements. Thus, careful consultation early in the IB program can reduce the number of hours needed to complete it.
IB majors are required to have an international experience consisting of a least one month abroad for a study abroad or an international internship. If this is a concern, there is an exemption process through the Director of the Carson and Iris Varner International Business Institute.

Grading System
University Grading System
Instructors assign a grade in each course for which the student is registered. The course instructor is responsible for correcting any error in grading.
University grades assigned to undergraduate courses are:
A- Excellent
B- Good
C- Satisfactory
D- Poor, But Passing
F- Failing
Assigned to students who are (1) enrolled in a course all semester but fail to earn a passing grade, or who (2) stop attending a class without officially withdrawing
WX- Withdrawal
Assigned to students who officially withdraw from a course before the dates specified in the withdrawal policy.
CR- Credit
Assigned to students who do satisfactory work in a course which is offered only on a Credit/No Credit basis. Certain courses in the University are offered only on a Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) basis. Refer to University Policy 2.1.12 These courses must be approved in advance by the Office of the Provost.
NC- No Credit
Assigned to students who do not do satisfactory work in a course which is offered only on a Credit/No Credit basis. Certain courses in the University are offered only on a Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) basis. Refer to University Policy 2.1.12 These courses must be approved in advance by the Office of the Provost.
P- Passing*
Assigned to students who earn an A, B, or C grade in a course they have elected to take under the Passing/Not Passing (P/NP) option.  The Credit/No Credit (CT/NC) option was replaced with Pass/No Pass (P/NP) with the implementation of Campus Solutions in 2015. *For Passing/Not Passing Information refer to University Policy 2.1.12
NP- Not Passing*Assigned to students who do not earn an A, B, or C grade in a course they have elected to take under the Passing/Not Passing (P/NP) option. The Credit/No Credit (CT/NC) option was replaced with Pass/No Pass (P/NP) with the implementation of Campus Solutions in 2015.*For Passing/Not Passing Information refer to University Policy 2.1.12
I- Incomplete
An instructor may assign an incomplete (I) grade 
to a student who is doing passing work but, because of reasons beyond the student's control (such as illness), is unable to complete the required work by the end of the term. The student must have attended class to within three weeks of the close of the semester or to within one week of the close of the summer session.
The instructor must also complete the required Incomplete Grade Form found at My.IllinoisState.edu> Academics > Teaching or at the Office of the University Registrar Faculty and Staff Resources page. The form allows the instructor, student, and Department/School to acknowledge the student’s remaining requirements, deadline date, and default grade to be assigned. If neither the Incomplete Grade Form nor a Grade Change Request form is submitted, the student’s I grade will lapse to an F after one year. 
Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the University Registrar.
Students will not be allowed to graduate with an incomplete on their record.
AU- Audit
Important considerations: A class taken under the audit option does not count toward a degree; it does not count toward full-time student status for financial aid and other purposes, nor does it count toward total hours enrolled in determining registration priority. Students auditing a class will be charged all applicable tuition and fees. An auditor is expected to attend regularly. A student may register as an auditor in a class or classes if space is available. To audit, a student must obtain a Request for Auditor Registration form from the Registrar Service Center, request the instructor sign it and return the signed form to the Registrar Service Center by the published deadline.
M- Missing
Assigned when no grade has been received from the instructor after the grade submission deadline has passed.
S - Satisfactory
Assigned to students who satisfactorily complete a course offered only on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis.
U - Unsatisfactory
Assigned to students who do not satisfactorily complete a course offered only on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis.
Grade Point Average
In calculating major and cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA), the grade point equivalents are 4 for A, 3 for B, 2 for C, 1 for D, and 0 for all other grades. The 0 value of F is computed in the student’s GPA, the 0 value of grades I, AU, CR, NC, P, NP, M, and WX is not computed in the student’s GPA.
To be eligible for graduation, a student must have a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 (C) in all courses taken at Illinois State University for which grades of A, B, C, D, F are assigned. Certain majors may require a higher GPA for graduation. State licensure requirements in education majors mandate that no course in which a student receives a grade below a C can be used to fulfill a student’s required coursework in the program. Failures are considered in the total number of semester hours taken in computing the GPA.
The following table illustrates how grade points are counted to determine the GPA.

The GPA is computed by dividing grade points earned by semester hours counted for GPA. In the case above, a GPA of 2.67 is calculated by dividing 24 (total grade points) by 9 (semester hours for GPA). Grades of WX, P, NP, CR, I, and NC do not affect the GPA. 
Class Standing
Students in a bachelor’s degree program are classified as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A student must have completed 30 semester hours to be classified as a sophomore, 60 hours to be classified as a junior, and 90 hours to be classified as a senior. Students not working toward a degree at Illinois State are listed as Unclassified Students.

Major in Sociology
Sociology majors at Illinois State explore a diverse range of topics and learn to think critically about the social world. Our distinguished faculty members are committed to helping students develop the analytical skills they need to gain a deeper understanding of the world in which we live.
Sociologists look under the surface of social life. They analyze data and develop theories in order to understand and explain social patterns, issues, and problems. Sociology not only helps us understand the roots of these issues and problems, but can also help inform policies that contribute to their solutions.

Anthropology is a discipline concerned with people in their entirety: our evolution and physical variation, the remnants of our prehistoric past, the cultural and linguistic diversity of human societies past and present.
Anthropology has four subfields: archaeology, anthropological linguistics, cultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. An anthropological education begins with learning the fundamentals. This means taking courses representative of all four subfields.
Students in the Anthropology major must complete one of the following sequences.
Anthropology Sequence

Accelerated Anthropology Sequence
View Accelerated Anthropology Course Requirements
Program Admission Requirements
The Accelerated Anthropology Sequence (AAS) is a pathway to the Master’s Program in Anthropology. Accelerated degree programs offer high-achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor’s degree and master’s degree with one additional year of study. Students accepted to the sequence will be allowed to take courses during their senior year that will count toward both the undergraduate and graduate programs in anthropology. Qualifying students must apply to the AAS in the spring semester of their junior year. Admission is based on space availability and competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures and deadlines are available on the Anthropology Program website.
Acceptance into the AAS constitutes acceptance into the Master’s Program in Anthropology and thus students will take up to 12 hours of graduate-level credits during their senior year. To transfer to graduate-only status for their second year, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the Master’s Program in Anthropology in the spring of their senior year. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing and have made good progress towards their M.A. degree during their senior year.
A maximum of 12 of the total 15 hours of elective courses may be taken for graduate credit
Some 300-level courses are offered for undergraduate or graduate credit. Students in the Accelerated Sequence who want to count a 300-level course toward their 12 hours of required graduate coursework, must enroll in the 300-level course for graduate credit at the beginning of the course in order for it to count.
To graduate in this sequence, a student must take at least one course for graduate credit during the senior year. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure approval.
Notes
The following anthropology courses may be taken by anthropology majors to fulfill General Education requirements but do not count towards electives for the major: ANT 143, ANT 176, ANT 197
All anthropology majors are encouraged to take SOC 275 (Social Statistics) as part of their undergraduate curriculum, however no Sociology courses may be counted toward the 40 hours in Anthropology required for the major
Special topics courses (ANT 306 and ANT 383) vary from semester to semester may be taken twice for credit if the content is different.
All Graduate School admission deadlines and policies apply to courses for graduate credit
Minor in Anthropology

Master of Science in Chemistry Program
Master of Science in Chemistry Education Program
Master of Chemistry Education Program
Master of Science in Chemistry Program
Degree Offered: M.S.
The program is broad-based, and allows students to specialize in any of the sub-disciplines (physical, organic, inorganic, analytical, biochemistry, or chemical education), although coursework is required in at least four sub-disciplines. The Master of Science in Chemistry (M.S.) is a thesis-based M.S. degree requiring 31 credit hours including: Four hours each in CHE 490 (Research) and CHE 499 (Master's Thesis) are required as part of the 31-hour program, although most students will register for more than the total of eight required hours while pursuing the degree. Students select a research advisor and work closely with that faculty member to complete a thesis based upon original research. Upon completion of a written thesis, a final oral examination/thesis defense is required.
In general, students admitted to the Master of Science in Chemistry program should have completed coursework in science and math equivalent to that required for a B.S. degree in Chemistry at Illinois State University or have received an American Chemical Society-certified B.S. degree from another school. If a student will be admitted to the Master's degree program with deficiencies (though no student will be admitted with 12 or more credit hours of deficiencies in Chemistry coursework), the deficiencies will be identified as specific courses and students will have to complete those courses as early as possible in order to bring their background coursework to the required level. All deficiencies should be completed by the end of the third semester in the program. In general, credit earned for completion of deficiencies does not apply toward M.S. degree requirements unless the student petitions the Department and receives approval to count specific courses (up to a maximum of six credit hours) for graduate credit in the student's plan of study, and only courses listed as approved for graduate credit on Course Finder may be counted.
This 31-hour degree requires: 
21 hours of 400 and/or CHE 300-level courses including a minimum of 12 credit hours of courses at the 400 level in 3 sub-disciplines (analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, biochemistry, and chemical education)
2 hours: 1 hour each CHE 492 and CHE 494
8 hours: 4 hours each in CHE 490 and CHE 499
Successful completion of a thesis based upon original research and oral examination/thesis defense Graduate coursework in related disciplines may be substituted with consent of the Chemistry Department.

The graduate program coordinator will determine whether the 24 hours should be granted when the student applies for admission to the program. Technically, this is not transfer credit and does apply to any of the limits listed below.
Doctoral candidates who have previously earned a master’s degree or its equivalent approved by one of the regional accreditation associations or by the agencies recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation may be granted 24 semester hours of advanced standing credit toward the doctoral degree if approved by the program and the Graduate School at the time of admission. The 24 hours are subtracted from the total hours required for the doctorate from the baccalaureate, if applicable. The 24 hours are not counted toward the maximum allowed transfer credit limit or computed in the cumulative graduate GPA. A copy of the transcript showing the earned degree is required. Degree equivalency from foreign institutions is determined by International Admissions. Advanced standing credit will only be granted for courses completed within five years of admission to the doctoral professional practice program and a grade of B or higher must have been achieved.

Invested in those with greatest financial need
For many years, Illinois State has invested heavily in our students with the greatest financial need. We continue to provide nearly $13 million in ISU Access Grants annually to serve students from families in the lowest income levels. Combined with MAP and Pell Grants, these students generally pay little or nothing for tuition and fees. In many cases, the Pell Grant can also cover a portion of students' housing charges.

Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.

Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.

Facility and Space Use
Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts Facilities
Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts Facilities
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service.  Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the College of Fine Arts.  This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as “facilities and grounds”).  These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged.  In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service.  Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn.
The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.
Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus with the exceptions noted in the Illinois State University policies and procedures. Outdoor areas such as the quad are under the oversight of Conference Services.
Scheduling and Using College of Fine Arts Spaces
Center for the Performing Arts
To schedule or reserve space in the Center for the Performing Arts, please complete the Center for the Performing Arts Request Form. All reservations for CPA spaces shall adhere to the CPA Venue Rental Policy. This includes a signed contract outlining all costs incurred and a signed Outside Group Protection of Minors policy for external organizations. All ticketing, rental, and labor fees will be negotiated and agreed upon before the event.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event will be responsible for all costs incurred including, but not limited to, clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event cease and desist. 
Centennial East – Kemp Recital Hall, Classroom Spaces
To schedule or reserve space in Centennial East, including Kemp Recital Hall, contact the School of Music Office Support Specialist, Peggy Dehaven, at 309-438-3839, or email at pldehav@ilstu.edu.
Centennial West – Westhoff Theatre, Classroom Performance Spaces
To schedule or reserve space in Centennial West, contact the School of Theatre and Dance Office Manager, Natasha Warloe, at 309-438-8784, or email at nmwarloe@ilstu.edu.
Anyone wishing to reserve space controlled by The School of Theatre and Dance must complete a room request form.
Please note that space is very limited during the academic year and all School of Theatre and Dance requests take precedence.
Administration and Procedural Application
Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the coordinator of the space will consider (a) priority for requests within the College of Fine Arts over non-College of Fine Arts requests, (b) whether the space is suitable and appropriate for the event or activity, and (c) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (e.g., security staff; Emergency Medical Service personnel; other security; insurance requirements; and related loss prevention measures).  Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity including, but not limited to:
Anticipated crowd size, density, and control, public/private, ticketed or G.A. event.
Noise likely to be generated and impact on other University activities in the vicinity.
Impact on traffic and parking.
Adequacy and suitability requested to the space.
Event history, hours, performer history, first-time event.
Compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies.
Potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others.
Presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics.
Any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section.
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for College of Fine Arts spaces are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis.  Occasions may arise when an official University or College activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the coordinator of the space will work with the individual or organization sponsoring the displaced activity to find a suitable alternative date and time reasonable under the circumstances. 
Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements.  When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets. Ultimately, it is the decision of the coordinator of the space to determine what measures or requirements are necessary.  An appeal of this decision may be made to the Dean of Fine Arts or designee.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event will be responsible for all costs incurred including, but not limited to, clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
If certain risks are associated with the proposed event or activity, the following offices may make recommendations to the Coordinator of the space as necessary.
Illinois State University Police Department
Environmental Health and Safety
Emergency Management
Risk Management
The coordinator of the space may adjust staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs. A final decision will be made after consideration of all recommendations.
Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
Events Involving Minors
If the proposed event or activity will involve minors, the sponsor or group must complete the University Program/Activities Involving Minors registration and comply with the University Protection of Minors Policy.
Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associated with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events in a College of Fine Arts space should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible.
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use College of Fine Arts facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests.  Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.
Violations or Non-Compliance Behaviors
Violation of this procedure could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including, but not limited to, the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods.  Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) will be handled through the Code of Student Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office.  Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources.  Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

Reserving Facilities 
To request space at University Galleries, complete the Facility Request form.
This request must be submitted to University Galleries at least ten business days before the proposed event. If the event includes catering, a workshop, an invited speaker, and/or minors, we require a minimum of fifteen business days notice. The facility cannot book past 8 p.m. Clients may not reserve a gallery for weekly or monthly meetings due to the shifting nature of available space determined by the exhibitions on view.
Exhibition Liability
University Galleries regularly rotates exhibitions. The number of staff required to tend to the artwork and the insurance value of artworks changes with the exhibitions. For this reason, University Galleries' definition of whether events are appropriate for the space also changes.
University Galleries cannot host dances, weddings, or fashion shows. We do not allow fog machines, candles, or pyrotechnics of any kind. Clients may not reserve a gallery for dance, theatre, martial arts, or other physical practices that may pose a risk to the artwork on view or events that are not in line with the purpose of the space.

University Galleries reaches capacity at 192 people. Events that require capacity beyond 175 throughout the space will be denied. Events that require lecture seating beyond 90 guests will likely be denied without further documentation.
Town of Normal
University Galleries' space is leased from the Town of Normal. We do not approve events scheduled for the outside of our facility. Any events or happenings outside of the facility must be approved by the Town. Please request contact information if needed.

Honors in History
Honors work in the Department of History has been designed to offer to qualified undergraduates the opportunity to develop an independent, individualized program of study while working closely with departmental faculty in the field of their special interest. Students who complete the requirements will graduate with Departmental Honors, which will be noted on their transcript and diploma.
Honors Admissions Requirements
To be admitted to the Honors Program, stu­dents must: (1) be members of the University Honors Program, and (2) have completed 45 hours, at least nine hours in history with a minimum GPA of 3.50 in History. Recom­mendation of at least one member of the departmental faculty is required as is the approval of the Departmental Honors Advi­sor. Students may also be invited to apply by a faculty member. In specific cases these requirements may be waived but only with the express approval of the Departmental Honors Advisor and the History Department Chairperson.
Honors Study Requirements
In order to graduate with distinction as a Departmental Honors Scholar in the Department of History, the student must complete (1) at least 6 hours of Honors work in the major - HON/HIS 299, HIS 301 (which require pre-approval from the Departmental Honors Advisor), (2) all university graduation requirements, (3) all regular requirements for the major, and (4) all University Honors requirements as outlined in the catalog. The Departmental Honors Advisor and the History Department Chairperson will regularly evaluate students in the program. Any student whose work does not meet the minimal standards of the program will not be allowed to continue.
For more information on Honors in History, including admission and retention standards, please visit the Honors website.

Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of History participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors and one interdisciplinary major at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the Major in European Studies and the following minors: African-American Studies; African Studies; Classical Studies; European Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies; Native American Studies; Urban Studies; and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Program section.
Major in History
Admission to the History major, including the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, may be restricted by the lack of available Department resources.
The Department of History encourages stu­dents seeking a bachelor’s degree to develop both global and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of history and to apply these methods to their studies in other disciplines. To develop their skills in historical analysis and to learn to think critically about histori­cal accounts, students complete HIS 100, HIS 200, and HIS 300. To acquire both a well-rounded and a global understanding of historical processes, students are required to take 6 hours each in the 3 fields of European, non-Western, and United States History.
The Department of History recognizes the value of language to the study of history from a global perspective. For this reason, the department recommends that all students majoring in history complete a Bachelor of Arts program. Those students majoring in history but choosing to pursue a Bachelor of Sciences program must complete a minor program.
Students in the History major must complete one of the following sequences.
General History Sequence
B.A. students are encouraged to improve their career opportunities by minoring in another discipline. B.A. students not opting for a minor must choose an area of concentration by taking a minimum of 9 hours in any field other than history or foreign language; at least 3 of these hours must be in 200- or 300-level courses. B.A. students are encouraged to continue their language studies beyond the 12 hours required by the Bachelor of Arts.
B.A. and B.S. students in either the History (non-teaching) or History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence must complete HIS 100 during their freshman year as History majors and should complete HIS 200 before enrolling in any 300-level History course. HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen. Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor. HIS 300 is a capstone course to be taken in the student’s last full semester on campus. For students in the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, this would be the semester just prior to student teaching.
6 hours of non-Western History listed in group 3 of “History Courses by Group for the Major.” At least one of the non-Western electives must be at the senior level.
HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen, Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor.
B.A. students are encouraged to complete a minor; but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than history or foreign language, with at least 3 hours at the 200-or 300-level.
B.S. students must also complete a minor.
View General History Sequence Course Requirements
General History Accelerated Sequence
High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate programs in History. Students can then apply to the History graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the History graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the History Department advisor.

Earning College Credit in High School
Earning College Credit in High School
There are many ways to earn college credit while you're still in high school.
Dual Credit Courses
Some high schools offer the option of taking community college courses which count for credit at both the high school and college level. If you have done so, be sure to submit your official college transcript. It will be reviewed and credit will be awarded as appropriate.
How to Transfer Credit
How Credit Will Transfer
Advanced Placement (AP) Credit
Advanced Placement (AP) is a program sponsored by the College Board that allows high school students to take accelerated classes that may count for college credit. If you take AP courses and get high enough scores on the official exams, you may be awarded course exemption and/or credit.
Accepted AP Exams and Scores
International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program
Sponsored by International Baccalaureate, the program is designed to prepare students for success in the University and beyond in a variety of subjects. A student who has participated in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme should have his or her scores sent to the University Registrar. Students with the appropriate scores will be awarded proficiency for specific International Baccalaureate Program work as indicated.
Accepted IB Scores and Courses
College Level Examination Program (CLEP)
College Level Examination Program tests are another way to earn course exemption and/or credit toward General Education requirements at Illinois State.
Learn More About CLEP Credit
State Seal of Biliteracy
Illinois State University accepts the State Seal of Biliteracy from any state as equivalent to two semesters (8 credits) of language study (LAN 111-112) in languages offered at the University. If the seal is granted in a language not offered at Illinois State University, eight credit hours of lower division foreign language will be awarded. Students must request course credit for their seal within three academic years after graduating from high school. No credit will be awarded for the State Commendation toward Biliteracy, though students with the commendation are encouraged to determine their level through self-placement exams or proficiency exams.

Class Attendance
The attendance regulation of the University is based on two principles. First, students are expected to attend class regularly; and second, students are primarily responsible to the instructor in matters pertaining to class attendance. Every student will be held responsible for class attendance and successful completion of academic work. Attendance regulations are intended to encourage student maturity and are based on the assumption that academic success is the student’s primary goal in college.
Equitable Treatment Of Students Participating In University Sponsored Activities
Student Bereavement Policy
Student Absences Due to Service as a Volunteer Emergency Worker
Absence of Student Due to Religious Beliefs
 - Any student in an institution of higher learning, other than a religious or denominational institution of higher learning, who is unable, because of his or her religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examination, study, or work requirement and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up the examination, study, or work requirement that he or she may have missed because of such absence on a particular day; provided that the student notifies the faculty member or instructor well in advance of any anticipated absence or a pending conflict between a scheduled class and the religious observance and provided that the make-up examination, study, or work does not create an unreasonable burden upon the institution. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the student such an opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of his or her availing himself or herself of the provisions of this Section.  For more information please see the ISU Policy 1.6 Religious Accommodation Policy available at: 
https://policy.illinoisstate.edu/conduct/1-1-6.shtml
. 
Military Service - In accordance with state laws and regulations (330 ILCS 60/5.2), a service member enrolled in an institution of higher learning who is unable, because of his or her military service, to attend classes on a particular day or days has the right to be excused and to reschedule a course examination administered on such day or days. The faculty and administrative officials shall make available to the service member an opportunity to make up any examination he or she has missed because of his or her military service. 
Extended Student Absences - As a service to students, the Dean of Students Office can provide notification to instructors when students have been/will be absent from class(es) for three or more consecutive days and are unable to notify their instructors. Students are not required to report absences to the Dean of Students Office; the office serves as a resource to help students reach instructors. The student is responsible for providing verification of the absence to instructors, if requested. Only instructors have the authority to excuse students from class(es) or coursework. 
Student Leave of Absence Policy 2.1.5 - Students may request a leave of absence for up to six (6) consecutive terms (Fall, Spring, Summer).
Class Registration - Assistance with the class registration process may be obtained by contacting the Registrar Service Center at Registrar@IllinoisState.edu, (309) 438-2188, or in-person in Moulton Hall Room 107. Students at Illinois State University are responsible for following registration procedures to assure valid registration for classes. A student may not attend a class for which they are not properly registered. A correct registration is each student's responsibility. The University reserves the right to void the registration of any student who becomes ineligible for enrollment. 
Classroom Disruption - Policy 4.1.17
College of Arts and Sciences foreign language graduate requirement
College Level Examination (CLEP) (Undergraduate Proficiency Examination) 
Campus Conduct
Class Standing - Students in a bachelor’s degree program are classified as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A student must have completed 30 semester hours to be classified as a sophomore, 60 hours to be classified as a junior, and 90 hours to be classified as a senior. Students not working toward a degree at Illinois State are listed as non-degree-seeking students.
Code of Student Conduct - The Code of Student Conduct details the rules and regulations for students and student organizations.
Course Load (Academic Load)  - A full-time undergraduate student carries between 12 and 17 hours. Courses taken on an audit (AU) basis do not count toward full-time student status. For enrollment verification purposes, 12 hours is considered full-time for undergraduate students. A student wishing to carry more than 17 hours in a semester (12 hours in summer) may seek permission to do so their academic advisor. The granting of this permission will depend on the student’s scholastic record. A freshman may not carry over 17 hours during their first semester. A student considering enrolling in any classes, including extension or correspondence, at another college or university with concurrent registration at Illinois State University should consult with their advisor.
Course Information - Numbering, types, terms used in course descriptions 
Course Repetition(s) - If a student completes a course, or drops a course after the tenth day of classes receiving a grade of WX, the student may repeat that course once.  Students seeking a third enrollment must obtain permission from the academic advisor who will submit a Registration Clearance Permit request to the Registrar Service Center to allow the student to register in the course. When a course has been repeated at Illinois State University, the most recent grade (A, B, C, D, F) that the student earns will replace the previous grade in the cumulative GPA calculation. A grade of WX, AU, I, CR, CT, NC, P, NP will not replace the grade, nor the hours earned in the prior attempt. The previous grade(s) will not be removed from the student’s transcript, and the credit hours from only the last attempt can be used toward meeting minimum hourly requirements.When an articulated course has been repeated at another college or university, that grade will not replace the previous grade earned at ISU nor can it be used to improve the cumulative or major grade point average. However, the transfer credit may be used to satisfy a prerequisite, major, minor, or other requirement at Illinois State University.Students repeating a course to improve their GPA should be aware that many professional and graduate schools recalculate GPAs to include all courses attempted. Graduate students should be aware that this regulation does not apply to general courses (see Limitation of Credit for General Courses section in the Graduate Catalog). Courses that allow multiple enrollments have a separate grade recorded for each enrollment and each grade (A, B, C, D, or F) is counted toward the student's GPA. Previous grades are not replaced or removed from the student’s record until the maximum allowable enrollments or credit hours for the course has been exceeded.An Illinois State student considering repeating or enrolling in any classes, including extension or correspondence, at another college or university while enrolled at or pursuing a degree from Illinois State University should consult with their advisor.
Credit Hour Policy 4.1.19
Credit for Military Service 
Cross-listed Course - Cross-listed courses are offered by more than one department or school, but treated as one course for credit purposes. A cross-listed course will be considered as one course regardless of the department/school through which the student registered for the course. This is a general rule that applies to all cross-listed courses taken for any purpose.
Deans’ List Policy 2.1.10
Departmental Proficiency Examination (Undergraduate Proficiency Examination)
Double Majors and Simultaneous Degrees
Double Majors: Students completing requirements for two majors concurrently are eligible to receive only one degree unless 150 or more hours have been completed and a Simultaneous Degree Application is submitted and approved.

Interdisciplinary Studies and University Studies graduates will walk with the College of Education. Student Honors/Honor Cords
Diplomas are issued to students after completion of all degree requirements, including major(s), minor(s), general education, professional education, if applicable, and other specific degree requirements. Students completing requirements for two majors concurrently are eligible to receive only one degree. The degree awarded is based on the degree corresponding to the primary major. One diploma is issued to the student upon completion of both majors and all other degree requirements. Students who have earned simultaneous bachelor’s degrees will receive two diplomas. Majors are not printed on the diploma; however, all majors and minors are printed on the official transcript. Diplomas are mailed to students approximately 8 to 10 weeks following graduation.

Second Bachelor’s Degree - Policy 2.1.9 Baccalaureate Degree Programs A student who has already received one bachelor’s degree from Illinois State University or from another regionally accredited college or university may receive a second bachelor’s degree at Illinois State University upon completion of degree requirements. Students must meet the admission requirements for the major selected and meet appropriate deadlines. Second bachelor degree seeking students are required to fulfill degree requirements as listed in the catalog at the time of admission to the second bachelor degree program. The program of studies completed for the second degree must include at least 32 semester hours of coursework taken after the granting of the first degree, of which 30 hours must be taken in residence at Illinois State. At least 24 of the 32 hours completed toward the second degree must be at senior college-level (courses numbered 200 and above).  
A student may apply for and receive two bachelor degrees in the same term. To receive two degrees simultaneously, completion of a minimum of 150 credit hours is required. The degrees may be the same (e.g., two B.A. degrees) or different (e.g., a B.A. and a B.S.). The majors may be the same as long as two different sequences are completed. All requirements for both degrees, both majors and sequences, and all general graduation requirements must be met.
Senior College Hours - The senior college hours (courses numbered 200 or above) must total at least 40 hours. Coursework transferred from other colleges and universities is not counted as senior college credit if freshmen and sophomores are regularly permitted to enroll in such work. No credit from two year colleges may be counted as senior level.
State Seal of Biliteracy -  According to the Illinois State Board of Education, the State Seal of Biliteracy “recognizes public high school graduates who have attained a high level of proficiency in one or more languages in addition to English.” Illinois State University accepts the State Seal of Biliteracy from any state as equivalent to two semesters (8 credits) of language study (LAN 111-112) in languages offered at the University. If the seal is granted in a language not offered at Illinois State University, eight credit hours of lower division foreign language will be awarded. Students must request course credit for their seal within three academic years after graduating from high school. No credit will be awarded for the State Commendation toward Biliteracy, though students with the commendation are encouraged to determine their level through self-placement exams and/or proficiency exams (refer to the Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures (LAN) website). Students with the Seal of Biliteracy may also be eligible for higher levels of credit, which can be earned through taking a course (see self-placement exams) or a proficiency exam (refer to the LAN website).

Transferring credit - Registrar's Office processes
Transcripts Policy 2.1.23
Tuition and Fees - Tuition, fees, on-campus housing charges and dining charges are determined by action of the Board of Trustees on a yearly basis. Tuition and fees other than health insurance are assessed at a per semester hour rate. Health insurance is assessed to all students enrolled for nine or more semester hours. Upon being first enrolled in a degree program at Illinois State University, tuition rates for undergraduate students will be locked for a four-year period. Certain degree programs qualify for the locked rate to be extended beyond the four-year period. Tuition and fees are subject to change by action of the Board of Trustees and the General Assembly. For additional information, refer to the Student Accounts website.
Auditors - Students who take all courses as auditors without credit are charged at the current rate per semester hour for tuition and fees. Auditing a class does not count toward full-time student status for financial aid and other purposes. 
Changes in Schedule - A student who drops a course will be charged according to the schedule on the Student Accounts website. 
Materials Charges - Material charges listed with individual course information on the Course Finder website or at My.IllinoisState.edu in the registration system, are automatically charged to the student’s account. A student may supply his or her own materials and request the instructor, in writing, to reduce the materials charge.
Payment of Tuition and Fees - Illinois State University offers payment plans for current semester charges. Students will choose what plan works best for their needs or must pay in full by the designated date listed on the Student Accounts website to avoid being enrolled in an administrative plan. Paying in full is the only way to avoid a payment plan fee.
Insurance Fee Reduction - A student may receive a reduction of the insurance fee if the student demonstrates equal or better insurance coverage and completes the application and provides proof of other coverage each semester prior to the 15th calendar on the day of the fall and spring semesters and the 8th calendar day of the summer semester. Visit Student Insurance website for specific information.
Reduction in Charges:
Pursuant to guidelines established by the University, part or all of a student’s tuition and fees may be reduced because of the student’s death or disability, extreme hardship, or institutional error.
A student may receive a reduction of all tuition and fees if the University declares him or her ineligible for enrolled status prior to the first day of regularly scheduled class.
Visit the Housing website for information regarding changes to or cancellation of housing contracts 
Visit the Campus Dining website for information regarding changes to or cancellation of a dining plan 
Students or parents who believe that individual circumstances warrant exceptions from published policy may appeal to the Associate Vice President for Student Affairs.
Resident and Non-Resident Status - An applicant or enrolled student is classified either as a resident of Illinois, a non-resident, or a foreign student. Residency for tuition purposes is different from residency for voting, taxing purposes, undergraduate degree academic residency, or residency requirements of on-campus doctoral programs. A student must be a U.S. citizen or have been approved for U.S. Permanent Resident status in order to be considered as an Illinois resident. An individual’s residency status is based on information from the admission application. A student who is not a resident of Illinois pays an out-of-state differential charge per credit hour. All other fees are the same for non-residents. A student under 18 years of age is considered a non-resident if the student’s parents are not legal residents of Illinois. A student over 18 years of age is considered a non-resident if the student is not a legal resident of Illinois. A student who begins as a non-resident may later qualify for resident status. Additionally, select students receive an alternate rate of tuition of 1.0 times the current in-state rate, including: students admitted from Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin; veterans and students utilizing VA education benefit, students who meet the eligibility requirements (as set for the specific fall term in question) for our principal scholarship programs, namely the Presidential, University, Redbird, Transfer Student Scholarship, or Phi Theta Kappa Scholarship; students who are identified by a unit (Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts, Forensics, Gamma Phi Circus) through their selective processes (audition, portfolio, etc.) based upon a specific talent. Guidelines for qualifying and special circumstances may be found on the University Registrar’s website. Personnel within the Office of the University Registrar are responsible for determining residency. 
Summer Session Tuition and Fees - The summer session tuition and fees are assessed at a per semester hour rate. Students enrolled for six or more semester hours will be charged the current rate for health insurance.
Withdrawal and Reduction of Tuition and Fees - If a student drops a course or withdraws from Illinois State University, charges for tuition, mandatory fees, and outreach fees will be adjusted based on the date of the course drop or withdrawal. A registered student who officially withdraws from the University may receive a reduction of tuition and fees according to the schedule on the Student Accounts website. The University may designate an abbreviated withdrawal policy for summer session, special courses, and short courses.All notifications of withdrawal from the University must be in person with photo ID to the Registrar Service Center, 107 Moulton Hall, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, or in writing and addressed to Office of the University Registrar, Illinois State University, Campus Box 2202, Normal, IL 61790-2202, faxed to (309) 438-8652, or emailed from the student’s Illinois State University email account to Registrar@IllinoisState.edu.
Undergraduate Teaching Assistantships (UTA) and Undergraduate Research Assistantships (URA)
Undergraduate Teaching Assistantships are available in nearly all departments of the University to juniors and seniors who have demonstrated excellence in a particular discipline and high overall  scholastic achievement.  The purpose of the program is to assist the faculty in the improvement of instruction and to provide UTAs with a valuable learning opportunity.
Undergraduate Research Assistantships (URA) are available in selected departments for students who have demonstrated excellence in a particular discipline with significant potential in research. The purpose of the program is to work closely with faculty members and to provide students valuable opportunities for research.
The responsibilities and nature of the UTA and URA assignments are determined by the departments and colleges. Some departments provide the opportunity for credit to be earned by the UTA under a General Offerings course (291 Seminar: Undergraduate Teaching Assistants). Three hours is the maximum amount of this credit that may be allowed for graduation. Tuition and fees are assessed in the usual manner for all credit earned in the UTA and URA experiences. Application forms are available in the departmental and college offices.

The first way is to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program (see below for details).
The second way is to complete the Illinois Transferable General Education Core Curriculum available through the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) (see below for details).

Languages, Literatures and Cultures
Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language.

Graduate
Doctor of Philosophy
Doctor of Philosophy
The Doctor of Philosophy degree is designed for the preparation of individuals competent in research and scholarly inquiry whose career objectives are generally in research, teaching, consultation, or leadership roles in universities, colleges, institutes, educational agencies or private practice. 
Minor Fields
Approved 4/14/88
A doctoral student may select a minor field (or fields) of study. The selection and composition of a minor field (or fields) must have the approval of the Graduate School and the major and minor departments. A minor field may, under certain circumstances, be in the same department or school as a major field.
Curriculum Requirements
A doctoral degree is not granted on the basis of a student having successfully completed a certain number of courses, but upon evidence of scholarly attainment as demonstrated especially by competence in research.
Students may transfer up to 40% of the required program coursework, not including comprehensive exams and dissertation hours, toward the completion of the doctoral degree with approval from the department/school. The transferred coursework must be graduate level, with a grade of B or higher (or equivalent as verified on the transcript), and may or may not have been used toward another graduate level degree. The coursework being considered for transfer will be reviewed on an individual basis with final approval from the department/school.
Time Limitations
Approved 4/14/88, Updated 3/22/01
All requirements for a doctoral degree, including the dissertation, must be completed by the end of eight calendar years beginning with the date the student first registers as a doctoral degree student. This time limit applies to enrollment in all graduate coursework in the student’s program. If a course taken to complete the requirements for the doctoral degree is not taken within the eight-year period allowed for the degree program, the student’s department may require the student to retake the course for credit or allow the student to demonstrate current knowledge of the subject matter. If the latter is used, currency must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the department offering the course through successful completion of an appropriate examination or other assessment if available from the department. Courses from other institutions falling outside the limitation of time may not be used in a graduate program. When graduate study is interrupted by military service or other contingencies, the eight-year limit may be extended by the Graduate School. A Request to Extend Time to Complete Graduate Degree Program must be completed by the student, graduate coordinator/director, and if applicable, dissertation chair, and submitted to the Graduate School for approval or denial. The Request to Extend Time to Complete Graduate Degree form is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Admission to Candidacy
Approved 4/14/88
A doctoral student will be admitted to candidacy after: a Degree Audit has been submitted to the Graduate School and approved, (b) the comprehensive/preliminary examination has been successfully completed and reported to the Graduate School, (c) the research tool requirement has been met, and (d) the dissertation proposal has been approved by the dissertation committee and by the Graduate School. (Both the Degree Audit and Proposal Approval forms are available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Comprehensive/Preliminary Examination
Approved 4/14/88; edited 2/17/15; edited 9/19/17; edited 4/24/18
The comprehensive/preliminary examination is written, or, written and oral. It is also concerned with the student’s professional competence and ability to undertake independent research. The content, process, scheduling, administration, and evaluation of the examination is to be determined by each department and school. To apply for comprehensive examinations a student must:
be in good standing in a program, and
have a Degree Audit on file in the department or school,
not be on academic probation,
and have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 at the time of the examination.
A student who fails the examination must wait until the next academic term before repeating the entire examination unless there are reasons that make an exception advisable. Exceptions must be requested from the Graduate School in writing by the student and advisor/director. Students who have twice failed the examination are not to repeat the exam unless they have completed further study as prescribed by the department chair or school director. Comprehensive examinations may not be administered more than three times to individual students. Department chairs and school directors are to notify students, by letter, of examination results within thirty days from the examination date. A copy of this letter is to be sent to the Graduate School. (If it is a student’s second failure, recommendations for further study and appropriate warning of the situation are to be included in the letter.) At the point of the third failure of comprehensive examination, the department or school will recommend to the Graduate School that the student be dismissed from the degree program.
The Graduate School must receive the results from the department or school within 5 working days of notifying the student.
Registration for Dissertation Work
Approved 12/11/86
Fifteen semester hours of 599 Doctoral Research are required for the doctoral degree. Any student using the services of the academic staff or the facilities of the University must be registered for the semester or term during which the services are rendered or facilities are used. Also, to register for 599 the student must be working on the research under the direction of the advisor or dissertation chairperson. 
Continuous Registration
Approved 11/14/96; edited 4/26/23
Once admitted to candidacy in a doctoral degree program, as defined by the Admission to Candidacy policy, and after the student has completed all coursework on the Degree Audit and the required number of hours (15) of 599 Doctoral Research, the student is required to maintain continuous registration until the submission of all final deposit materials to the Graduate School. The requirement for continuous registration may be fulfilled by maintaining registration in 1 hour of 599 each semester through the semester of degree completion. (Students registering for less than 9 credit hours in fall or spring, or less than 6 credit hours in summer, will not have the insurance fee automatically assessed. (See the Health Insurance website for further information.) The requirement for continuous registration does not apply during a summer term unless the student is proposing, defending, or graduating in that term. Registration for 599 may be in absentia. If circumstances prohibit continuous registration, a student must request a leave of absence. Any student interrupting registration without obtaining a leave of absence, upon re-enrollment and/or reinstatement, must pay tuition and fees for one credit hour of 599, at the current tuition and fee rates, for each of the delinquent semesters. Any student requesting reinstatement in a degree program after a lapse of one calendar year must complete an application for readmission to the program. Continuous registration for an upcoming term may be waived if all materials are submitted to the Graduate School by the Friday before the next semester starts. Consult with the Graduate School for more information.
Full-Time Equivalency
Approved 1/27/21
If a student has completed the maximum requirement of dissertation hours for the program, but more time is needed, a student may register for a 1 credit of dissertation for up to two (2) semesters.  This 1 credit course will be counted at a level equivalent to full-time study for the purposes of loan deferment, continued use of university student services, and graduate assistant full-time enrollment eligibility requirements.  An approved PERS 938 (Reduced Course Load Request) is still required for graduate assistants enrolled in this option.
If more time is needed beyond the first two (2) semesters, a formal request for an extension can be made to the graduate school by the dissertation advisor. Extensions may be approved for a maximum of two (2) additional semesters only if a clear plan for completion has been submitted and only if the student is working at a full-time equivalency on dissertation work.  Graduate students who are using this extension cannot hold a graduate assistantship.  If the extension is approved, the full-time equivalency could be used for loan deferment or continued use of student services ONLY. 
An extension request must address the following:
An explanation of why the extension is necessary;
If the extension is being requested for one or two semesters;
Explanation of how the student is working at a full-time equivalency on dissertation work;
A timeline for completion in the requested time-frame; and
Approval of the dissertation advisor, the graduate coordinator, and the Graduate School.
Use of the 1 credit dissertation option (or extended period) may also affect the cost of attendance if a student is applying for federal and state financial aid.  Students should consult the Financial Aid department to determine how use of the option will impact the student’s eligibility for federal and state financial aid.

Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) Program
Degree Offered: M.F.A.
The Master of Fine Arts in Art is a 60-hour program that emphasizes both theory and practice in the production, history, and teaching of the visual arts. Candidates will be expected to demonstrate artistic proficiency in at least one of the following disciplines: painting and drawing, sculpture and expanded media, printmaking, video, ceramics, photography, or glass. Candidates will also be expected to demonstrate proficiency in written and oral communication.
Students may also engage in an internship or apprenticeship. This may take the form of a guided teaching experience or work in a professional area related to the student's area of interest. The exact nature of this experience will be worked out through counseling between the major advisor and the student and will be tailored to best suit the needs of each student. This project will be subject to approval of the student's graduate committee and the School Director.
It should be understood that the accumulation of 60 semester credit hours is not the primary criterion in evaluating a student’s final achievement. The primary criterion in the evaluation of the MFA degree will be a Thesis Exhibition which demonstrates intellectual maturity and artistic proficiency in the student’s major studio area. In addition to the Thesis Exhibition, the MFA degree requires the completion of a Thesis Supportive Statement, which is a critical essay that focuses on the student’s studio work, its development, and its cultural and historical references. The M.F.A. Candidate will be required to pass an oral defense.
This 60-hour degree program requires:
36 semester hours must be taken in the Wonsook Kim School of Art, of these at least 24 must be at the 400 level
24 semester hours must be in the student's major studio area, of these at least 18 must be at the 400 level
Of the total required 60 hours, 12 semester hours must be taken in art history, or nine hours may be taken in art history with three hours in related areas such as aesthetics, philosophy, or anthropology, or ART 494 MFA Seminar
3 hours: ART 494 MFA Seminar. Taking the MFA Seminar to satisfy Art History requirements does not substitute for this requirement (494 is included within the 36 hours)
6 hours: ART 496 M.F.A. Exhibition and Supportive Statement. This will involve a comprehensive exhibition of studio work, an exhibition-related written project, and a comprehensive oral examination. A candidacy review must take place before a student can enroll in ART 496 or schedule the MFA exhibition and must include approval of proposal for the supportive statement. (496 is included within the 36 hours.)
The School reserves the right to keep images of original work produced by graduate students for educational and archival purposes.
