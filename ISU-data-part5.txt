Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

These may include minimum GPAs, minimum scores on the GRE, GMAT or other standardized exams, personal statements or interviews, examples of work, or letters of recommendation.
In order to be admitted to Illinois State as a graduate student, a student must have earned a four-year bachelor's degree or its equivalent from a college or university that is accredited by the appropriate regional accrediting association. Some doctoral or certificate programs may require a master's degree.
Applying to Multiple Programs in One Academic Year 
If applying for a graduate program with multiple sequence options, all applicants are required to select one program sequence at the time of their application submission. Applying for multiple sequences within a graduate program is not permitted. However, you may add an additional sequence to your program of study after successful completion of your first semester of the graduate program with program coordinator approval. Applicants may apply for multiple graduate programs if desired, provided a unique application is submitted for each individual program. This intention must be communicated to the Graduate School prior to any application submissions. Application fees for graduate programs are non-refundable.
Transcripts
Application review
Applicants must present unofficial transcripts from each college or university other than Illinois State at which graduate, undergraduate, or non-degree credit was earned. The unofficial transcript should be easily readable and clearly indicate degree(s) awarded, courses and course grades for each term.
Current or former Illinois State students do not need to send ISU transcripts. However, you may need to provide transcripts from all other colleges attended.
Transcripts can be uploaded to the application for admissions. If sending official electronic or mailed transcripts, we recommend sending your transcripts after you've submitted your application to better match your transcripts with your file.

Application Fee
All applicants are required to submit a nonrefundable application fee or documentation for an application fee waiver. Your application will not be processed until the application fee or fee waiver verification is received. Due to the Declaration of Finances required, international applicants are not eligible for an application fee waiver. This fee or waiver must be received by the program's deadline.
Learn more about the fee or waiver documentation.
Enrollment Deposit Fee
A non-refundable enrollment deposit fee (EDF) of $150 will be required for all new graduate students prior to course registration or the issue of immigration documents. Students will only pay the enrollment deposit one time. Any student enrolling in multiple or additional programs, or needing to defer to a future semester, will not have to pay a subsequent enrollment deposit. Please refer to this webpage for more information on how to pay your EDF.
Additional Requirements
Master's students
In addition to the overall Graduate School requirements above, an individual applying to a master's program must also have a minimum 2.8 GPA (on a scale in which an A is a 4.0) for the last 60 hours of undergraduate work (approximately the junior and senior years).
Many graduate programs require a higher GPA or may require the GRE or GMAT.
Specialist students
In addition to the overall Graduate School requirements above, an individual applying for a specialist program must also have a minimum 3.0 GPA (on a scale in which an A is a 4.0) for the last 60 hours of undergraduate work (approximately the junior and senior years).
Doctoral students (Ph.D., Ed.D)
In addition to the overall Graduate School requirements above, an individual applying to a doctoral program must also:
have earned a master's degree or equivalent in a discipline appropriate to the specific doctoral program
have a minimum 3.0 GPA (on a scale in which an A is a 4.0) for their graduate coursework or in the last 60 hours of undergraduate work (approximately the junior and senior years).
The GRE is not required for admission to all doctoral programs. Check if the GRE is required specifically for admission to your intended program.
Types of Admission
Unconditional Admission 
An unconditional admission generally carries no academic restriction, though you may be expected to take some courses to make up for some undergraduate deficiencies.
Probationary Admission
A probationary admission may be granted to students who don't meet the minimum requirements of the program and the Graduate School but whose academic records demonstrate promise of high achievement. These students will be on probation when admitted and will frequently be given a trial period of one semester to meet specific requirements. Students who meet these requirements within the trial period will be taken off probation and admitted unconditionally; students who don't meet these requirements may be terminated from graduate studies at Illinois State at the end of the trial period.
Conditional Admission
A conditional admission is issued when the application for admission is missing a required official/final document. Most applicants are reviewed with unofficial transcripts or test scores. Admission to the University is contingent upon receiving official or final transcripts with a degree posted and/or official test scores, like GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS, etc. Documents must be sent to the University prior to the start of the term. A student may be terminated from graduate studies at Illinois State if the missing documentation is not provided within one semester.
Undergraduate Taking Graduate Coursework for Graduate Credit
Undergraduates can take graduate courses for graduate credit if they (1) have junior or senior status, (2) have a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or higher. Total registration cannot exceed 15 hours in that semester. Graduate coursework will not be calculated in the undergraduate GPA. The transcript will indicate the grade received, the number of credit hours the course was worth, but 0 hours earned. This is due to only earned hours are calculated in the GPA. This is common transcript language used by Registrar/Bursar offices. There is no guarantee graduate courses taken will be accepted by another University as transfer credit.
All coursework taken for graduate credit must be approved by the department or school advisor and the Graduate School BEFORE registration. A form titled, "Undergraduate taking Graduate Credit" is available electronically in My.IllinoisState to be completed by the undergraduate advisor for approval.
Up to 12 hours of coursework will count toward an ISU graduate degree program only and has a limit of 6 years to be used. Coursework taken for graduate credit cannot count toward a bachelor's degree except under the provisions of integrated bachelor’s/master’s degree and accelerated master’s degree programs. This opportunity is also extended to last semester seniors of other universities who find it possible to take graduate work at this University while completing requirements for the bachelor's degree on their own campuses. Such graduate courses cannot be used in meeting bachelor’s degree requirements on their own campuses.

Actuarial Science Sequence
This sequence of the major is designed to teach the students the mathematical founda­tions of actuarial science, and to prepare them for careers as actuaries in a variety of fields dealing with the risk of potential finan­cial losses, such as life insurance, health in­surance, financial risk management, property/casualty/liability insurance, pensions, or employee benefits.
View Actuarial Science Sequence Course Requirements
Statistics Sequence
This sequence of the major is designed to prepare students for statistical work in industry and government. In addition to learning the mathematical foundation in statistics, students study at least two cognate areas of application of statistics from Biometrics, Computer Science, Econometrics, Finance and Psychometrics. This will allow students to experience many fields of statistical applications and select a field of their choice for a career. It is to the advantage of the student to have a minor or double major in one of the above areas. However, it is not a requirement for the sequence. Senior students in good standing are encouraged to take upper level applied statistics courses from selected cognate areas.

Admissions Information
The MSBE is a non-licensure degree that assumes an undergraduate knowledge base in business and education which students with undergraduate degrees in business education will normally have acquired. Students admitted with a non-business undergraduate degree may have to complete foundation courses before enrolling in any business graduate course. Specific requirements will be determined by the department chair and the program coordinator. The responsibility for demonstrating prior academic coverage of the material at the appropriate level rests with the student and should be completed at least one month prior to the beginning of the first semester of coursework.
Students with a non-business undergraduate degree should expect to complete foundation courses as required to enter courses that have an MBA designation. Foundation courses may not count as part of the MSBE required courses. Some or all of the foundation courses (up to 17 hours) may be waived based on an individual's previous academic work.
Master of Science in Business Education
Degree Offered: M.S.
This 33-hour program requires:  
9 hours required core courses from: MBA 416, MBA 411, MBA 430.
18 hours from Business Education. Students can choose from: BE 422, BE 430, BE 454, BE 462, BE 465, BE 480, BE 482, 
BE 400, BE 401, BE 402, or other courses as approved by department. 
6 hours of electives from MBA courses or MKT 414 
or 
hours from 400-level courses in the College of Education.

College of Education (COE)
College of Education Programs
The College of Education includes the Departments of Educational Administration and Foundations and Special Education, the School of Teaching and Learning, the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center, and the Laboratory Schools (Thomas Metcalf School and University High School).
The mission of the College of Education is to purposefully allocate intellectual and financial resources to develop talented graduates and professionals, establish meaningful partnerships, foster innovative faculty and staff, advance academic excellence, and embrace the principles of Realizing the Democratic Ideal.
The preparation and continuing professional development of educators is the core of this mission. The guiding framework for teacher education at Illinois State University, “Realizing the Democratic Ideal,” captures the values of education programs: “To teach in a democracy is self-consciously to take up the burden of improving the ethical and intellectual quality of our societal dialogue by including in it as many educated voices as possible.” A comprehensive offering of degree, licensure, and outreach programs operated year round at both undergraduate and graduate levels constitutes the primary mechanism through which the mission is fulfilled.
The College also fulfills its strategic mission of influencing education by interacting directly with practitioners in the field in a variety of partnerships in schools and other associations and agencies. In addition, the College is an active participant in discussions related to educational policy development within national, state, and local arenas.

A minimum of 40 of the 120 total hours must be senior college hours (200-300 level courses)

The Dietetics sequence is a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The DPD program is an integrative program that prepares graduates for careers that influence the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities through the knowledge of food and nutrition. The program prepares students for supervised practice leading to the eligibility for the CDR credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist. This sequence provides the first step for students wanting to become a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). To become an RDN, students must apply for an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after graduation, and, upon completion, are eligible to take the registration examination. Beginning January 1, 2024, a minimum of a master’s degree will be required for eligibility to take the registration examination for dietitians. An ACEND Verification Statement of DPD Completion will be given to students completing this sequence meeting program requirements. This official statement is required for graduates to begin an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after acceptance, and for other professional applications requiring verification of DPD completion. The DPD program at Illinois State University is currently accredited by the ACEND of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ACEND is recognized by the United States Department of Education and can be contacted at 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 800-877-1600, Ext 5400.

Dietetics Accelerated Sequence
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in Dietetics/Family and Consumer Sciences. Students can then apply to the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors. All accreditation information for the Dietetics Sequence applies to the Dietetics Accelerated Sequence. Students in the Dietetic Accelerated Sequence are encouraged to apply to ISU’s Track Two Dietetic Internship during the Spring Match in their senior year. The Dietetic Internship would take place following the senior year and be incorporated into the master’s degree.
Program Admission Requirements for New and Continuing Students: High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree.

Food and Beverage Management Sequence
The Food and Beverage Management sequence prepares graduates for careers in the growing food industry by combining business and management principles with food service and hospitality skills. This sequence requires fewer science courses (no organic and biochemistry) and more business and food-related courses than the dietetics sequence. Consumers spend about 50 percent of their food dollars in restaurants, cafeterias, fast-food franchises, at work, or at school. Food systems managers organize these operations and make sure the foods are attractive, nutritious, and safely prepared. This sequence meets the requirements to become eligible to take the Certified Dietary Manager Credentialing Exam. Popular career options include restaurant manager, cafeteria manager, caterer, and corporate, hospital, long-term care, or school food service manager. Employment opportunities also exist with companies that produce food, food ingredients, or processing equipment, and food safety inspection, food sales, marketing, and business management.

Major in Interior Design
The Interior Design (ID) program at Illinois State University offers two sequences: Interior Design Sequence, and Interior Design Accelerated Sequence, which is a pathway to the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program.
Interior Design Sequence
The Interior Design program prepares students to design innovative, functional, supportive, and responsible interior environments that positively impact the quality of life within a global market. The curriculum develops students’ skills and knowledge in design, sketching and technical drawing, space planning, interior construction and building systems, materials specifications, historical interiors, building codes and accessibility guidelines. Sustainability issues and universal design are emphasized. The program is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA) and focuses on the broad range of specialties within commercial interior design. Course content is based on the knowledge and skills needed to pass the National Council for Interior Design Qualification certification exam. To be licensed in the State of Illinois, graduates of a 4-year CIDA-accredited program must have a minimum of two years professional work experience and pass the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) Examination. Passage of this exam also qualifies the individual for professional membership in interior design organizations such as International Interior Design Association (IIDA) and American Society of Interior Designers (ASID).

Admissions Information
Illinois State University School of Social Work completes criminal background checks for all BSW and MSW candidates and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic record and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon successfully completing and passing a national background check. The school may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to the MSW/BSW program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some field instruction placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the MSW/BSW degree. Many agencies require criminal background checks as a condition for accepting a placement in their program. It is the student's responsibility to inquire with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to the MSW/BSW program, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the School of Social Work. Students must meet the criteria for professional and ethical behavior as set forth by the School of Social Work.
A 60-hour, two-year program for fulltime students, students may also choose part-time programs and should consult with the advisor. New students who have undergraduate degrees in fields other than social work or from non-accredited schools of social work complete the full program. Students with undergraduate social work degrees from programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education may be given advanced standing and complete the 30-hour advanced curriculum.
NOTE: Academic credit for life experience and/or previous work experience is not given, in whole or in part, in lieu of any social work course.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct. The University also reserves the rights to establish additional requirements with respect to specific University venues.
In general, the University will not interfere with events, meetings, assemblies, rallies, demonstrations, vigils, or protests in public areas of University facilities and spaces unless participants engage in one or more of the following behaviors:
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent (a) the orderly conduct of a function or activity, including, but not limited to, classes and other instructional activities; research; study; lectures; presentations; performances; meetings; interviews; administrative business; ceremonies; or other public events; or (b) access to any room or space in which such functions or activities are being held.

Continue to engage in behaviors prohibited in this section after a University official or University Police has declared that the conduct violates University policies or an applicable law and has instructed the participants to modify or
    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

Master of Science in Chemistry Program
Master of Science in Chemistry Education Program
Master of Chemistry Education Program
Master of Science in Chemistry Program
Degree Offered: M.S.
The program is broad-based, and allows students to specialize in any of the sub-disciplines (physical, organic, inorganic, analytical, biochemistry, or chemical education), although coursework is required in at least four sub-disciplines. The Master of Science in Chemistry (M.S.) is a thesis-based M.S. degree requiring 31 credit hours including: Four hours each in CHE 490 (Research) and CHE 499 (Master's Thesis) are required as part of the 31-hour program, although most students will register for more than the total of eight required hours while pursuing the degree. Students select a research advisor and work closely with that faculty member to complete a thesis based upon original research. Upon completion of a written thesis, a final oral examination/thesis defense is required.
In general, students admitted to the Master of Science in Chemistry program should have completed coursework in science and math equivalent to that required for a B.S. degree in Chemistry at Illinois State University or have received an American Chemical Society-certified B.S. degree from another school. If a student will be admitted to the Master's degree program with deficiencies (though no student will be admitted with 12 or more credit hours of deficiencies in Chemistry coursework), the deficiencies will be identified as specific courses and students will have to complete those courses as early as possible in order to bring their background coursework to the required level. All deficiencies should be completed by the end of the third semester in the program. In general, credit earned for completion of deficiencies does not apply toward M.S. degree requirements unless the student petitions the Department and receives approval to count specific courses (up to a maximum of six credit hours) for graduate credit in the student's plan of study, and only courses listed as approved for graduate credit on Course Finder may be counted.
This 31-hour degree requires: 
21 hours of 400 and/or CHE 300-level courses including a minimum of 12 credit hours of courses at the 400 level in 3 sub-disciplines (analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, biochemistry, and chemical education)
2 hours: 1 hour each CHE 492 and CHE 494
8 hours: 4 hours each in CHE 490 and CHE 499
Successful completion of a thesis based upon original research and oral examination/thesis defense Graduate coursework in related disciplines may be substituted with consent of the Chemistry Department.

Admission/Retention Requirements
All incoming undergraduate students are initially enrolled in the B.A. or B.S. programs, depending on their interests. Those who wish to apply to the B.F.A. program do so no earlier than the first semester during their sophomore year. 
The School of Art expects regular class attendance and supports faculty members who choose to reduce course grades for lack of participation, including excessive absences.
Students seeking admission to the Major in Art must comply with criteria established by the School of Art, including submission of a portfolio of work for review by the School. Students interested in the Art History Sequence will submit a statement explaining their interest in the field, in lieu of the portfolio. Specific requirements for the portfolio and statement may be obtained from the School office.
To graduate with a Major in Art (B.A., B.S.) students must complete all requirements of one of the School of Art’s Sequences: Studio Arts, Graphic Design, Art History, or Teacher Education. They must also earn grades of C or better and maintain a 2.50 GPA in all courses taken in the School of Art, in addition to maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00. Individual sequences may have higher requirements. Courses in the Major may be repeated no more than once for the purpose of attaining the necessary minimum grade. Students may not enroll for the next course in a related series until the minimum grade in the prerequisite course is achieved. Incoming transfer students must retake courses considered equivalents to courses in the Major for which they earned lower than a grade of C. Students who do not meet these criteria will be placed on probation with the School of Art; a student placed on probation more than once will be dropped from the School.
Admission to some Sequences in Art may be restricted by the lack of available School resources, especially in times of oversubscription. 
In times of oversubscription and limitations on resources within the School of Art, some Discipline Areas may require faculty screening of students’ supportive materials before allowing individual students to enroll in the second course in that Discipline.
All Sequences in the Major in Art require successful completion of the Art History Core, the Foundations program appropriate to that sequence, a series of courses specific to the chosen sequence, and electives in Art. Students must complete all Sequence Foundations courses before being permitted to continue in one of the sequences in the Art major; gifted students may be allowed to take 200-level courses in their areas of interest during the freshman year, pending approval of the School. Students must also complete all Art History Core courses before they may enroll in 300-level Art History courses.
Students must make every effort to complete the required Foundations courses in their first three semesters in the program. Under most circumstances students will formally declare intention to enter a particular sequence in the Art major by the second semester of the sophomore year. Students will arrange to participate in screening requirements for their preferred sequence; those not accepted into competitive sequences may be reconsidered the following semester and should consult with appropriate faculty for advice before rescreening. Also in the sophomore year, students will begin enrolling in courses appropriate to their sequence of interest. In the case of the Studio Arts Sequence, this also requires declaring a specific Discipline Area in consultation with the School’s academic advisor.
Students can begin to take Graphic Design courses after they have completed the Art History core and Studio Art Foundation courses. There is no portfolio review for admission but students must have and maintain a major and cumulative 2.50 GPA. Students whose cumulative or major GPA falls below 2.50 will not be allowed to register for Graphic Design courses until the GPA has been raised to a 2.50 or higher. Consult the School of Art for further information on admission and retention in the Graphic Design sequence.
Students will be admitted to the Art History Sequence with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 and grades of B or better in ART 155 and ART 156. See the School of Art office for more information. Students will be allowed to continue in the sequence if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 2.50.
All Art majors planning to become licensed teachers must apply for and be admitted to the University Teacher Education program. Grades of C or better in all Art and Education courses, and a 2.50 cumulative and major GPA are required by the Art Teacher Education Area for admission and retention in the Art Teacher Education sequence. Continuation in the Art Teacher Education Sequence is not automatic. Students’ performance will be evaluated each semester.
The sequence in Teacher Education may also be combined with a sequence in Studio Arts, Graphic Design, or Art History. Pursuing a double sequence may require additional semesters. However, this option is strongly recommended to prepare students for teaching art. Students are also encouraged to take coursework in Urban Education and Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. 
Students may apply to the B.F.A. Degree program beginning in their sophomore year.

By requiring intensive study, it develops depth within at least one Studio Discipline Area (ceramics, drawing, glass, intaglio, lithography, metal­work and jewelry design, painting, photography, sculpture, video, wood/metal or expanded media) through the completion of a specific series of courses. It likewise encourages exploration of new genres that break through traditional boundaries between disciplines and media. This sequence prepares students to work as visual arts professionals or pursue graduate studies.

In addition, students may gain professional experience in a graphic design internship. Internships will require a competitive portfolio review.
View Graphic Design Sequence Course Requirements
Art History Sequence
The Art History Sequence provides students a solid grounding in the history of art on both introductory and advanced levels. In addition, the sequence includes exposure to related disciplines outside the visual arts, training in foreign language, and experience in advanced research and writing skills. Together, these requirements prepare students for effective graduate work in Art History or other fields and for positions in a variety of art- and non-art-related fields. 
In special circumstances, students may satisfy the Art History language requirement with a language or languages other than “French, German, Italian or Spanish.” In such cases, the language(s) must be appropriate to the student’s plan of study and career goals. Alternate plans of language study must be approved by the Art History faculty in order to receive credit toward the sequence.
It is recommended that students select electives in courses related to Art History offered by the following departments/schools: Anthropology; English; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; History; Music; Philosophy; Theatre and Dance. Students are encouraged to consult with the Art History faculty for advice on choosing electives in Art History and other departments that will complement their own areas of interests. Faculty are also available for consultation on preparing for graduate school.
Students may combine Art History and Studio by declaring a second Sequence in Studio Arts and fulfilling all requirements for both sequences. This will include submitting a portfolio of art work for admission.
View Art History Sequence Course Requirements
Art Teacher Education Sequence
The Art Teacher Education Sequence is a program that emphasizes a comprehensive approach that supports state and national student learning standards and teaching performance standards in the visual arts. Also stressed are creative and critical thinking, studio techniques, understanding the learner and developing skills to become an effective teacher. Students completing this sequence are eligible to apply for teaching licensure with a K-12 endorsement for teaching art in the State of Illinois.

La Solicitud Alternativa de Ayuda Financiera de Illinois proporciona un camino para que estos estudiantes calificados soliciten subvenciones del Programa de Premios Monetarios (MAP), el programa de subvenciones basado en la necesidad más grande del estado para estudiantes universitarios de bajos ingresos.

The Food, Nutrition and Dietetics (FND) program at Illinois State University offers four sequences: Dietetics Sequence, Dietetics Accelerated Sequence, Food and Beverage Management Sequence, and Food and Beverage Management Accelerated Sequence.
Students in the Food, Nutrition and Dietetics major must complete one of the following sequences.
Dietetics Sequence
The Dietetics sequence is a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The DPD program is an integrative program that prepares graduates for careers that influence the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities through the knowledge of food and nutrition. The program prepares students for supervised practice leading to the eligibility for the CDR credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist. This sequence provides the first step for students wanting to become a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). To become an RDN, students must apply for an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after graduation, and, upon completion, are eligible to take the registration examination. Beginning January 1, 2024, a minimum of a master’s degree will be required for eligibility to take the registration examination for dietitians. An ACEND Verification Statement of DPD Completion will be given to students completing this sequence meeting program requirements. This official statement is required for graduates to begin an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after acceptance, and for other professional applications requiring verification of DPD completion. The DPD program at Illinois State University is currently accredited by the ACEND of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ACEND is recognized by the United States Department of Education and can be contacted at 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 800-877-1600, Ext 5400.

For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors. All accreditation information for the Dietetics Sequence applies to the Dietetics Accelerated Sequence. Students in the Dietetic Accelerated Sequence are encouraged to apply to ISU’s Track Two Dietetic Internship during the Spring Match in their senior year. The Dietetic Internship would take place following the senior year and be incorporated into the master’s degree.
Program Admission Requirements for New and Continuing Students: High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree.
View Dietetics Accelerated Sequence Course Requirements
Food and Beverage Management Sequence
The Food and Beverage Management sequence prepares graduates for careers in the growing food industry by combining business and management principles with food service and hospitality skills. This sequence requires fewer science courses (no organic and biochemistry) and more business and food-related courses than the dietetics sequence. Consumers spend about 50 percent of their food dollars in restaurants, cafeterias, fast-food franchises, at work, or at school. Food systems managers organize these operations and make sure the foods are attractive, nutritious, and safely prepared. This sequence meets the requirements to become eligible to take the Certified Dietary Manager Credentialing Exam. Popular career options include restaurant manager, cafeteria manager, caterer, and corporate, hospital, long-term care, or school food service manager. Employment opportunities also exist with companies that produce food, food ingredients, or processing equipment, and food safety inspection, food sales, marketing, and business management.

Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Graduate Certificate
For Social Work Students
The WGSS graduate certificate sequence offer students a conceptual vocabulary for recognizing the intricacies of power and teaches them to identify the barriers that hold social inequalities in place. The sequence’s intersectional approach to social issues increases cultural competency by providing practitioners with a working social justice conceptual toolkit that is easily integrated in their professional work.
This 12-hour graduate certificate encourages social work practitioners not only to understand more fully the daily obstacles their clients face, but also to empower their clients by providing them with the skills they need to succeed. Please consult this Graduate Catalog and the WGSS program advisor for details.
Post-MSW Professional Educator License Graduate Certificate
Interested students who have previously completed a master's in social work degree but wish to obtain a professional educator license with a "school social worker endorsement" from the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) may complete the required coursework and a school social work practicum placement. The program is offered part-time over 2 years; the first year consisting solely of coursework and the second year consisting of a 700 hour practicum placement in a school setting with a school social worker and a concurrent seminar course. During the program, students also complete the required social work "content exam" and reading modules, which allows them to be eligible to apply for and obtain licensure from ISBE upon completion of the certificate program. Thus, when all course and field practicum requirements are met, students submit their application to ISBE to receive their "professional educator license (PEL) with a school social work endorsement".
17 total hours are required
3.0 cumulative GPA is required
The required courses must be completed with grades of "C" or better (with the exception of field-related courses, which require a grade of “B” or better or Credit, if graded on a Credit/No Credit scale).

FAQs
What facilities and spaces can be reserved for use by the University community or the public?
A wide variety of facilities and spaces can be reserved for appropriated uses.  A listing of types of facilities and spaces as well as contact information to make reservation is available at [insert link].
How do I reserve a facility or space?
While reservation processes may differ slightly between departments and units, a person wanting to use a University facility or space should:
Contact the scheduling coordinator for the facility or space you want to use to check on its availability.  A list of facilities and contact information can be found at [insert link].
Complete the required forms to reserve the facility or space.
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the event planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (e.g., security staff; Emergency Medical Service personnel; other security; insurance requirements; and related loss prevention measures). 
Reservations for facilities and spaces are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis.  Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the event planner will work with the individual or organization sponsoring the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. 
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements.  Events may be evaluated for the likelihood and consequences of potential risks. 
The department or unit that reserves and oversees the facility or space will provide an agreement to the party requesting the reservation that defines the date, time and location for the event or activity and expectations for security, insurance, and safety regarding the event along with any additional special requirements.
The reservation is complete when the agreement is signed by both parties and all expectations and requirements are met.
How are decisions made on requests to use University facilities or spaces?
Reservations for facilities and spaces are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis.  Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the event planner will work with the individual or organization sponsoring the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. 
Risk factors associated with an event will be assessed and reasonable expectations for security, insurance, and safety provided to the party requesting use of a facility or space.  Failure to meet these expectations may result in cancelling of a reservation.
Why might my event not be approved?
The request to reserve space contains missing information, is a misrepresentation or contains false information. 
The intended use of a facility or a space is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The party requesting use of a facility or a space previously committed significant or repeated violation of Illinois State University Policies or rules governing the scheduling and use of University facilities and spaces.
The intended use of a facility or space would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The party requesting use of a facility or space does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The University does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested.  If this occurs, an Event Planner will work to find alternative dates.
Can I appeal a decision to deny my request to host an event in a University facility or space? 
An appeal of a denied request to host an event in a University facility or space may be made to the senior administrator with responsibility for that area.  A list is provided below:
Dean, Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts
Center for the Performing Arts, Centennial East, Centennial West
Director of Athletics
Redbird Arena, Horton Fieldhouse, Horton Pool, athletic fields, tennis courts
Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost
Academic buildings for non-class purposes, Lab schools (Metcalf School, University High School), outdoor space
Vice President for Finance and Planning
Parking areas
Vice President for Student Affairs
Bone Student Center, Braden Auditorium, Bowling and Billiards Center, Student Recreation Building, McCormick Hall, Gregory Street Fields, residence halls, lobbies, meeting rooms, green spaces surrounding residence halls
Vice President for University Advancement
Alumni Center, Ewing Cultural Center
What is the cost to reserve and use a facility or space on campus?
The University establishes fee rates for use of University facilities and spaces based on the relationship between the University and the person or organization using the facility.  Rental rates may vary depending upon whether the individual or organization is considered a RSO, a University organization, an Alumni organization, the public, or a nonprofit charitable organization.  In addition, the facility or space being used and the requirements for the activity affect the costs.
Can I sell merchandise in a facility or space on campus? 
Generally, the University prohibits solicitation and sales in University facilities and spaces.  Exceptions to this rule, are found in the Solicitation and Sales in University Facilities and Spaces section [insert link] of the Policy on University Facility and Space Use.
Do protests and demonstrations need to be scheduled with the University?
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities.  Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity. When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it.  When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
When would the University shut down a protest or demonstration?
A protest or assembly might be shut down by the University should the protest or assembly:
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent (a) the orderly conduct of a function or activity, including, but not limited to, classes and other instructional activities; research; study; lectures; presentations; performances; meetings; interviews; administrative business; ceremonies; or other public events; or (b) access to any room or space in which such functions or activities are being held. 
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent access to particular spaces where educational, health, or financial records are stored or located.

Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) Program
Degree Offered: M.F.A.
The Master of Fine Arts in Art is a 60-hour program that emphasizes both theory and practice in the production, history, and teaching of the visual arts. Candidates will be expected to demonstrate artistic proficiency in at least one of the following disciplines: painting and drawing, sculpture and expanded media, printmaking, video, ceramics, photography, or glass. Candidates will also be expected to demonstrate proficiency in written and oral communication.
Students may also engage in an internship or apprenticeship. This may take the form of a guided teaching experience or work in a professional area related to the student's area of interest. The exact nature of this experience will be worked out through counseling between the major advisor and the student and will be tailored to best suit the needs of each student. This project will be subject to approval of the student's graduate committee and the School Director.
It should be understood that the accumulation of 60 semester credit hours is not the primary criterion in evaluating a student’s final achievement. The primary criterion in the evaluation of the MFA degree will be a Thesis Exhibition which demonstrates intellectual maturity and artistic proficiency in the student’s major studio area. In addition to the Thesis Exhibition, the MFA degree requires the completion of a Thesis Supportive Statement, which is a critical essay that focuses on the student’s studio work, its development, and its cultural and historical references. The M.F.A. Candidate will be required to pass an oral defense.
This 60-hour degree program requires:
36 semester hours must be taken in the Wonsook Kim School of Art, of these at least 24 must be at the 400 level
24 semester hours must be in the student's major studio area, of these at least 18 must be at the 400 level
Of the total required 60 hours, 12 semester hours must be taken in art history, or nine hours may be taken in art history with three hours in related areas such as aesthetics, philosophy, or anthropology, or ART 494 MFA Seminar
3 hours: ART 494 MFA Seminar. Taking the MFA Seminar to satisfy Art History requirements does not substitute for this requirement (494 is included within the 36 hours)
6 hours: ART 496 M.F.A. Exhibition and Supportive Statement. This will involve a comprehensive exhibition of studio work, an exhibition-related written project, and a comprehensive oral examination. A candidacy review must take place before a student can enroll in ART 496 or schedule the MFA exhibition and must include approval of proposal for the supportive statement. (496 is included within the 36 hours.)
The School reserves the right to keep images of original work produced by graduate students for educational and archival purposes.

Honors in History
Honors work in the Department of History has been designed to offer to qualified undergraduates the opportunity to develop an independent, individualized program of study while working closely with departmental faculty in the field of their special interest. Students who complete the requirements will graduate with Departmental Honors, which will be noted on their transcript and diploma.
Honors Admissions Requirements
To be admitted to the Honors Program, stu­dents must: (1) be members of the University Honors Program, and (2) have completed 45 hours, at least nine hours in history with a minimum GPA of 3.50 in History. Recom­mendation of at least one member of the departmental faculty is required as is the approval of the Departmental Honors Advi­sor. Students may also be invited to apply by a faculty member. In specific cases these requirements may be waived but only with the express approval of the Departmental Honors Advisor and the History Department Chairperson.
Honors Study Requirements
In order to graduate with distinction as a Departmental Honors Scholar in the Department of History, the student must complete (1) at least 6 hours of Honors work in the major - HON/HIS 299, HIS 301 (which require pre-approval from the Departmental Honors Advisor), (2) all university graduation requirements, (3) all regular requirements for the major, and (4) all University Honors requirements as outlined in the catalog. The Departmental Honors Advisor and the History Department Chairperson will regularly evaluate students in the program. Any student whose work does not meet the minimal standards of the program will not be allowed to continue.
For more information on Honors in History, including admission and retention standards, please visit the Honors website.

Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of History participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors and one interdisciplinary major at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the Major in European Studies and the following minors: African-American Studies; African Studies; Classical Studies; European Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies; Native American Studies; Urban Studies; and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Program section.
Major in History
Admission to the History major, including the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, may be restricted by the lack of available Department resources.
The Department of History encourages stu­dents seeking a bachelor’s degree to develop both global and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of history and to apply these methods to their studies in other disciplines. To develop their skills in historical analysis and to learn to think critically about histori­cal accounts, students complete HIS 100, HIS 200, and HIS 300. To acquire both a well-rounded and a global understanding of historical processes, students are required to take 6 hours each in the 3 fields of European, non-Western, and United States History.
The Department of History recognizes the value of language to the study of history from a global perspective. For this reason, the department recommends that all students majoring in history complete a Bachelor of Arts program. Those students majoring in history but choosing to pursue a Bachelor of Sciences program must complete a minor program.
Students in the History major must complete one of the following sequences.
General History Sequence
B.A. students are encouraged to improve their career opportunities by minoring in another discipline. B.A. students not opting for a minor must choose an area of concentration by taking a minimum of 9 hours in any field other than history or foreign language; at least 3 of these hours must be in 200- or 300-level courses. B.A. students are encouraged to continue their language studies beyond the 12 hours required by the Bachelor of Arts.
B.A. and B.S. students in either the History (non-teaching) or History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence must complete HIS 100 during their freshman year as History majors and should complete HIS 200 before enrolling in any 300-level History course. HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen. Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor. HIS 300 is a capstone course to be taken in the student’s last full semester on campus. For students in the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, this would be the semester just prior to student teaching.
6 hours of non-Western History listed in group 3 of “History Courses by Group for the Major.” At least one of the non-Western electives must be at the senior level.
HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen, Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor.
B.A. students are encouraged to complete a minor; but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than history or foreign language, with at least 3 hours at the 200-or 300-level.
B.S. students must also complete a minor.
View General History Sequence Course Requirements
General History Accelerated Sequence
High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate programs in History. Students can then apply to the History graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the History graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the History Department advisor.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

This interdisciplinary minor prepares students to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in their communities. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world. The minor gives students opportunities to sharpen their analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action. The minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden their learning experience and career perspectives.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

 Minor in Ethnic Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies. 
18 credit hours required
Take 6 courses as indicated below from the following groups (at least 4 courses must be above the 100 level). With consent of the faculty advisor, students may use departmental or IDS 287, 298, or 398 courses for one course in Group II and/or one course in Group III.

Public health is an interdisciplinary field built upon knowledge in environmental health, health behavior/promotion, epidemiology, medicine and other areas of study. This minor provides students with a foundation in key public health courses and, in combination with various majors, can create opportunities for employment in public health settings and graduate study in a Master of Public Health program or other health disciplines.

How to Reserve a University Facility or Space
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality Facilities
Event Management, Dining and Hospitality
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality (EMDH). This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as “facilities and grounds”). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn.
The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.
Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by EMDH with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g., a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
Scheduling and Using EMDH Facilities
Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve space in the Bone Student Center or Braden Auditorium, contact Event Services at (309) 438-2222, email at 
EMDH@illinoisstate.edu
, or visit the EMDH website.
Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police Officer may ask that the event cease and desist.
Administration and Procedural Application
Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the event planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (e.g., security staff; Emergency Medical Service personnel; other security; insurance requirements; and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity including, but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, ticketed event or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the event planner will work with the individual or organization sponsoring the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police Department
Environmental Health and Safety
Emergency Management
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality
Risk Management
Office of General Counsel
Additional departments as the need arises
Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The event planner will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The committee will review the event details, assess the event, and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The committee must grant approval to all events referred for review before a reservation is finalized and confirmed.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred including, but not limited to, clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
Illinois State University Police Department recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events.
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Emergency Management Plan if necessary.
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
EMDH recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
Illinois State University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and EMDH may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
Reasons for Delaying or Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying or denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following:
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status.
The request to use space conflicts with a preexisting reservation, other events on campus, or lack of staff availability and no reasonable alternative time or place is available on the date requested.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to Vice President for Student Affairs or their designee.
Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associated with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall “hosting” of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building.
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.
Violations or Non-Compliance Behaviors
Violation of this procedure could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including, but not limited to, the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods. Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) will be handled through the Code of Student Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office. Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources. Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

All master's degree programs require a minimum of 50 percent of the non-thesis credit hours applied to the degree to be 400-level courses or above.
Academic Advisors
An advisory committee will be assigned upon admission. The School Director, in consultation with the student and faculty whom the Director deems appropriate, will select the candidate's portfolio committee. The portfolio committee chair must come from the student's studio area.
Transfer Credit
A student who does not have an earned master's degree usually may present no more than six semester hours of credit from another college or university for use in meeting the requirements of the M.F.A. degree. However, a student may present all earned hours from an M.A./M.S. program in Theatre Studies at Illinois State University for use in meeting these requirements.
The total hours required for a student with an earned master's degree will be based on an evaluation of the student's portfolio and academic record. However, the final determination will not be made until the student has completed a minimum of six semester hours in his/her major area of emphasis. The student's M.F.A. committee will supervise all evaluations. Refer to M.F.A. Transfer Credit in the Fields of Study and Degrees Granted section.
A minimum of 32 hours must be taken at Illinois State University
Residency Requirement
A student without an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least four semesters with at least two of them being full-time, consecutive semesters. A student with an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least two full-time, consecutive semesters. Summer session may be counted toward the two consecutive semester requirement.
The M.F.A. Portfolio
Each semester of enrollment the M.F.A. candidate will enroll in THE 501, M.F.A. Portfolio, for one hour credit. The portfolio is the backbone of the Master of Fine Arts program. It is designed to ensure the regular and systematic evaluation of the student's progress. The portfolio is a collection of materials, including examples of the student's work where appropriate, reviews, evaluations and other artifacts, which may record or characterize the student's experience in the program. The portfolio also contains the student's responses to evaluations as well as statements from the Portfolio Committee which provide direction for the student's future work in the program.
The student must have a portfolio evaluation for each full semester he or she is in the program. The written results of that evaluation are included in the portfolio. The portfolio provides a cumulative record of the student's progress which is carried over from semester to semester.
Finally, the portfolio, with its record of the student's activities in the program, provides the major objective basis for awarding the degree. Although the student may engage in major creative projects during his or her program, the portfolio stands in lieu of the traditional thesis or creative thesis project which is the culminating experience in many programs.
Qualifying/Comprehensive Examination
A qualifying examination is required prior to the exit portfolio presentation. It may be comprehensive to the extent that it examines the candidate's knowledge of the discipline of theatre; it may include graduate work the student is presenting for the degree; and it may include demonstration of proficiency. The examination will be conducted by the student's M.F.A. Portfolio Committee. The student may request that other faculty members with whom he/she has taken course work participate in the qualifying examination.
Final Portfolio Review and Exit Interview
To be eligible for the exit portfolio presentation, the student must (1) present a grade average of B or better with not more than six (6) hours of a grade of C; (2) have completed (or will complete in the current semester) two semesters of full-time resident study; (3) have a degree audit on file with the Graduate School; (4) have passed a qualifying examination; and (5) pass a final portfolio review and exit to be conducted by his/her M.F.A. Committee. The format of this review and exit will be determined by the M.F.A. Committee, who will, when the work is deemed satisfactory, recommend the student to the appropriate studio area for graduation. At least one week before the Graduate School graduation notification deadline, the School Graduate Faculty will meet to hear the studio area's recommendations. Once the Graduate Faculty has approved the student's graduation, the student will be recommended to the Graduate School for the granting of the degree.
Students should consult with their M.F.A. Portfolio Committees and the School Graduate Advisor for details and the calendar of the final portfolio review and exit. While no student is guaranteed graduation, those whose work is deemed unsatisfactory may be presented opportunities for remediation by their Portfolio Committees.

Admissions Information
Illinois State University School of Social Work completes criminal background checks for all BSW and MSW candidates and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic record and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon successfully completing and passing a national background check. The school may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to the MSW/BSW program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some field instruction placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the MSW/BSW degree. Many agencies require criminal background checks as a condition for accepting a placement in their program. It is the student's responsibility to inquire with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to the MSW/BSW program, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the School of Social Work. Students must meet the criteria for professional and ethical behavior as set forth by the School of Social Work.
A 60-hour, two-year program for fulltime students, students may also choose part-time programs and should consult with the advisor. New students who have undergraduate degrees in fields other than social work or from non-accredited schools of social work complete the full program. Students with undergraduate social work degrees from programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education may be given advanced standing and complete the 30-hour advanced curriculum.
NOTE: Academic credit for life experience and/or previous work experience is not given, in whole or in part, in lieu of any social work course.

Graduate Certificate in Social Aspects of Aging
A multidisciplinary program designed to offer a limited number of academically and professionally oriented graduate experiences in aging. The graduate certificate is located within the Department of Sociology and Anthropology in cooperation with the Departments of Family and Consumer Sciences, Psychology, Health Sciences, the School of Social Work, and Communication Sciences and Disorders. Please consult this Graduate Catalog and the program coordinator in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology for details.
Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Graduate Certificate
For Social Work Students
The WGSS graduate certificate sequence offer students a conceptual vocabulary for recognizing the intricacies of power and teaches them to identify the barriers that hold social inequalities in place. The sequence’s intersectional approach to social issues increases cultural competency by providing practitioners with a working social justice conceptual toolkit that is easily integrated in their professional work.
This 12-hour graduate certificate encourages social work practitioners not only to understand more fully the daily obstacles their clients face, but also to empower their clients by providing them with the skills they need to succeed. Please consult this Graduate Catalog and the WGSS program advisor for details.
Post-MSW Professional Educator License Graduate Certificate
Interested students who have previously completed a master's in social work degree but wish to obtain a professional educator license with a "school social worker endorsement" from the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) may complete the required coursework and a school social work practicum placement. The program is offered part-time over 2 years; the first year consisting solely of coursework and the second year consisting of a 700 hour practicum placement in a school setting with a school social worker and a concurrent seminar course. During the program, students also complete the required social work "content exam" and reading modules, which allows them to be eligible to apply for and obtain licensure from ISBE upon completion of the certificate program. Thus, when all course and field practicum requirements are met, students submit their application to ISBE to receive their "professional educator license (PEL) with a school social work endorsement".
17 total hours are required
3.0 cumulative GPA is required
The required courses must be completed with grades of "C" or better (with the exception of field-related courses, which require a grade of “B” or better or Credit, if graded on a Credit/No Credit scale).

Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies.

Facility and Space Use
General Revenue Facilities
General Revenue Facilities
General Revenue Facilities include classroom buildings, Alumni Center, lab schools, and outdoor spaces.
Scheduling of General Revenue facilities for non-academic use is coordinated by the University’s Conference Services. To ensure fulfillment of Illinois State University’s mission relative to teaching, research and service and to offset ongoing equipment, maintenance and janitorial costs, the University assesses user fees for this space. User fees for General Revenue space will be applied to the following categories. Classification of the appropriate category will be made by the Conference Services Non-Academic Scheduling Coordinator.
User Fee Rate Classification
Public
“Public” refers to a person or public organization not affiliated with Illinois State University. Public events would occur if the event is not sponsored by a University Department as part of official University business, by a Registered Student Organization currently registered with the Student Involvement Center, or by a Faculty/Staff member serving in a professional capacity such as a member of a professional organization which is educational in nature and directly related to the mission of the University.
University Organizations
“University Organization” means Illinois State University department/school/unit, college, division, or University-related organization. University organization events are those sponsored by a University Department as part of official University business, by a Registered Student Organization currently registered with the Student Involvement Center, or by a Faculty/Staff member serving in a professional capacity such as a member of a professional organization which is educational in nature and directly related to the mission of the University.
Notes
A University Department, Registered Student Organization, or Faculty/Staff member serving in a professional capacity (such as a member of a professional organization which is educational in nature and directly related to the mission of the University), who sponsors an event where an entry fee, admission fee, registration fee, voluntary donation for admission, or any other type of income collected or accepted at the event or in advance, will be assessed an on-campus user fee. If a fee, admission, or income is not collected, there would be no user fee assessed.
Reservation Information
The availability of facilities may be verified by calling Conference Services (438-2403). A Facility Request form must be completed with waiver signature, and completion of the minors policy to confirm the reservation. Reservations for facilities and outdoor spaces are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. The consideration of requests is made after academic scheduling is completed. Therefore, Facility Requests for Summer and Fall semesters may be submitted in advance but will not be considered until around February 1. Facility Requests for Spring semester may be submitted in advance but will not be considered until around September 1. A fully completed Facility Request form is required to be returned to Conference Services at least ten (10) working days prior to event. Requests received less than ten (10) working days prior to event will not be considered. Reservations are not considered final until a confirmation email is returned to the applicant. The University reserves the right to determine and/or limit space assignments for scheduled events.
Conference Services will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security, staff, insurance requirements, and related loss prevention measures. 
Risk assessment factors may include but are not limited to: anticipated attendance, venue capacity, street closures/traffic impacts; whether the event is designed to include minors; whether the event involves the serving of alcoholic beverages, public safety permits, third party vendors, or public safety officers; whether the event involves the use of fireworks/pyrotechnic devices, temporary structures, or modification to the infrastructure of the venue. Parties reserving facilities will be informed of terms and conditions of use, including potential insurance requirements or need for security, before a reservation is finalized.
If certain risks are associated with the proposed event or activity, the following offices may make recommendations to Conference Services as necessary.
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events.
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Emergency Management Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Conference Services recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
Conference Services may adjust staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event or activity shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up cost, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the Provost or designee.
Unscheduled Expressive Events
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas (Quad, Milner Plaza, People’s Park, Stevenson Plaza, Redbird Plaza, etc.) of the campus controlled or scheduled by Conference Services with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas.
Cancellation, No Show, Deposit
The organization must contact the Conference Services Scheduling Coordinator regarding cancellations. 
A cancellation fee of 50% of room rental will be assessed with less than 30 days of notice. A cancellation fee of 100% of room rental will be assessed with less than 10 days of notice. The organization/sponsor will also be assessed charges for labor, requested equipment, or other costs incurred by the University for the canceled event.
The University, at its discretion, may require organizations to post a partial or full advance payment/deposit when the facility is reserved, or at least ten (10) days in advance of the event. The deposit will be returned to the User if the facility is left in good condition following the event or will be returned to the User if notice of the event cancellation is received 30 days in advance of the event.
Billing
After the completion of the event, Conference Services will provide the User an invoice listing the user fees. Some events which require supervisory services may be invoiced separately by other departments. The User will pay the University for all unpaid invoices within 30 days after date of invoice. Accounts not paid in full within 30 days will be subject to 1 1/2 % interest per month and the User will waive the right to future space or equipment use. The User will be invoiced according to the original Facility Request form. Therefore, the user must notify the Scheduling Coordinator of any changes to the original Facility Request form at least five (5) working days in advance of the event. The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred, but not limited to, clean-up, special construction, set-up, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
University Rights and Regulations
Events with signed contracts or letters of agreement entered into between the University and the event sponsor will be honored. However, many University requirements, such as scheduled instruction and officially sponsored meetings, are sometimes not known when a request for University space is made. Therefore, the University reserves the right to re-locate events to comparable space when necessary, no less than ten (10) working days in advance of the event. 
Special Information About Metcalf Laboratory School and University High School
When school is in session, the University reserves the right to re-locate events to comparable space when necessary, or to cancel the reservation if the space is required for official University use no less than five (5) working days in advance of the event. Although the Lab Schools are included in the General Revenue Space inventory, they are first and foremost an elementary school and a high school. As such, they have extracurricular, after school and related activities unique to their educational purposes during the school year. These events include scheduled instruction, officially sponsored meetings, and athletic and post-season tournaments in which the schools are a participant.
The University requires users to provide Conference Services with event entry forms, registration forms, brochures and/or other advertising materials used to promote the event in advance for approval.
The University may exercise the right to enter any room for the purpose of inspection, repair, or emergency.
The User is required to adhere to all University policies, regulations, guidelines, and all local, state and federal laws. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in denial of future use of University facilities and services.
If a User provides false or misleading information, the University has the right to refuse future use of University facilities.
In addition to these guidelines, the University expects the individual or organization using General Revenue facilities to comply with any additional policies and regulations of the specific facility. Registered Student Organizations need to also comply with any additional policies and regulations as determined by the Dean of Students Office.
If the proposed event or activity involves minors, the sponsor or group must complete the University Program/Activity Involving Minors online application available at the Environmental Health and Safety website. This form will be reviewed and must be approved by the Minors Activity Committee in advance of the event. This confirmation should be sent to Conference Services.
The University may permit exceptions to these guidelines and may develop additional guidelines as appropriate.
Indemnity and Damages
The User shall assume full responsibility for the conduct of all participants attending the User’s event. As such, the User is liable for all damages resulting from participant utilization of the facilities and equipment provided by the University. The User will reimburse the University for all damages to facilities and equipment, including audio-visual equipment, including repair or replacement, resulting from the use of those facilities and equipment by the User and/or its participants. The University assumes no responsibility for loss or theft of personal property, or damage to personal property of the User or any of its participants. The User shall indemnify and hold harmless the University, its offices and employees, against any and all claims for loss, injury or damage to persons or property arising out of activities conducted by the User or its guests on or in University facilities. The University assumes no liability whatsoever for any property placed by the User in University facilities.
Insurance
User shall procure and maintain Commercial General Liability (including contractually liability) in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 annual aggregate. Sexual abuse/molestation shall not be excluded.
If alcohol will be served, User shall procure and maintain applicable liquor liability insurance, and assure that those that serve alcoholic beverages have completed TIPS/BASSET training.
All insurance carriers must have an A.M. Best rating of B+ or better and a financial rating of VI or better for Commercial General Liability and Liquor Liability insurance.
Evidence of insured coverage should be delivered to: Non-Academic Scheduling Coordinator, Conference Services, Illinois State University, Campus Box 8610, Normal, IL 61790-8610 at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the scheduled event. If such evidence is not received within ten (10) days prior to the event, the event may be subject to cancellation.
Safety and Supervision
Attendance at any event is limited to the fixed seating of the room or the established capacity in rooms where seats are not used. Standing in the aisles and behind seats during any program is prohibited except for those staffing the event.
Exits must be open and accessible at all times. No required exit door may be fastened so that the door cannot be opened from inside by use of the door handle or by pressure on the crash bar. Exit ways serving the room must always be adequately lighted when the room is occupied.
All materials used as decorations must be fire resistant or flame-proof. Nothing may be attached to windows, walls, drapes, posts, or furnishings without prior approval from the Scheduling Coordinator. Open flames are prohibited in all indoor facilities! Open flame requests for outdoor venues will be reviewed by Grounds and Environmental Health and Safety. 
Supervisory personnel for events requiring a supervisor, lifeguard, or technician will be assigned by the Conference Services Scheduling Coordinator and scheduled by either the Scheduling Coordinator, Recreation Services, or Classroom Technology and Learning Spaces. Costs for supervisory personnel will be paid by the user and are in addition to the user fee.  
The approval of the Facility Request is dependent upon the availability of the supervisory personnel.
Alcoholic beverages are not allowed in General Revenue space. Any violation will result in denial of future use of University facilities.
Smoking
Illinois State University is designated as a smoke-free campus. See Policy 5.1.7.
These guidelines apply to General Revenue Facilities. Inquiry should be made to the appropriate facility director for regulations and policies regarding other facilities.
Violation of the procedure could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including but not limited to the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods. Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) will be handled through the Code of Student Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office. Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources. Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

Admissions Information
Illinois State University’s Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders completes criminal background checks for all candidates for the Master’s Program in Speech-Language Pathology and the Doctoral Program in Audiology and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic records, and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon completing and passing a national background check. The department may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to a CSD graduate program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some clinical placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the advanced degree. Many clinical sites require criminal background checks for accepting a student clinician in their setting. It is the student’s responsibility to inquire with the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to a graduate program in CSD, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders. Students must meet the professional and ethical standards set forth by the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders.
In addition to the requirements of the Graduate School, the degree students must meet all the academic requirements and clinical practicum requirements for the Certificate of Clinical Competence of the American Speech-LanguageHearing Association. Copies of requirements for both Illinois and national certification 
can be found online. The graduate programs are accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation.
Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.00 in major courses and overall to retain their degree status and to be eligible for department clinicals. Enrollment by graduate students in the department's clinicals requires degree status. In all instances, permission of the Clinic Director is needed for practicum enrollment, and enrollments may be restricted. External graduate clinicals may require special coursework and will require a student to provide transportation to external settings arranged by the department.
A candidate for the master's degree must 
complete two external placements
 in order to qualify for the degree. A degree student in the Doctor of Audiology program must spend one year in residency in order to qualify for the degree. A year in residence is interpreted as three consecutive semesters
 of enrollment in CSD 598.90 for one credit hour each semester.

Major in Sociology
Sociology majors at Illinois State explore a diverse range of topics and learn to think critically about the social world. Our distinguished faculty members are committed to helping students develop the analytical skills they need to gain a deeper understanding of the world in which we live.
Sociologists look under the surface of social life. They analyze data and develop theories in order to understand and explain social patterns, issues, and problems. Sociology not only helps us understand the roots of these issues and problems, but can also help inform policies that contribute to their solutions.

Anthropology
Degree Offered: B.A., B.S.
Major in Anthropology
Anthropology is a discipline concerned with people in their entirety: our evolution and physical variation, the remnants of our prehistoric past, the cultural and linguistic diversity of human societies past and present.
Anthropology has four subfields: archaeology, anthropological linguistics, cultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. An anthropological education begins with learning the fundamentals. This means taking courses representative of all four subfields.
Students in the Anthropology major must complete one of the following sequences.
Anthropology Sequence
View Anthropology Course Requirements
Accelerated Anthropology Sequence
View Accelerated Anthropology Course Requirements
Program Admission Requirements
The Accelerated Anthropology Sequence (AAS) is a pathway to the Master’s Program in Anthropology. Accelerated degree programs offer high-achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor’s degree and master’s degree with one additional year of study. Students accepted to the sequence will be allowed to take courses during their senior year that will count toward both the undergraduate and graduate programs in anthropology. Qualifying students must apply to the AAS in the spring semester of their junior year. Admission is based on space availability and competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures and deadlines are available on the Anthropology Program website.
Acceptance into the AAS constitutes acceptance into the Master’s Program in Anthropology and thus students will take up to 12 hours of graduate-level credits during their senior year. To transfer to graduate-only status for their second year, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the Master’s Program in Anthropology in the spring of their senior year. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing and have made good progress towards their M.A. degree during their senior year.
A maximum of 12 of the total 15 hours of elective courses may be taken for graduate credit
Some 300-level courses are offered for undergraduate or graduate credit. Students in the Accelerated Sequence who want to count a 300-level course toward their 12 hours of required graduate coursework, must enroll in the 300-level course for graduate credit at the beginning of the course in order for it to count.
To graduate in this sequence, a student must take at least one course for graduate credit during the senior year. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure approval.
Notes
The following anthropology courses may be taken by anthropology majors to fulfill General Education requirements but do not count towards electives for the major: ANT 143, ANT 176, ANT 197
All anthropology majors are encouraged to take SOC 275 (Social Statistics) as part of their undergraduate curriculum, however no Sociology courses may be counted toward the 40 hours in Anthropology required for the major
Special topics courses (ANT 306 and ANT 383) vary from semester to semester may be taken twice for credit if the content is different.
All Graduate School admission deadlines and policies apply to courses for graduate credit
Minor in Anthropology
18 total credit hours in Anthropology required
Required courses

General Education Program Requirements
General Education Requirements
General Education provides students with a broad, common foundation of study upon which to build an undergraduate education. The program develops skills of oral and written communication, logical and scientific reasoning, and quantitative analysis. Courses in General Education explore ways of knowing in the various disciplines through examination of significant historical, social, cultural, and scientific issues. Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses.
General Education Requirement Options
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
1. Complete Illinois State University's General Education Program. The General Education Program requires 13 courses (39 semester hours).
View courses that satisfy ISU's General Education Program
The following categories of students must complete the Illinois State University General Education Program requirements:
Beginning Freshmen (refer to the Admissions section of this catalog for complete definition).
Students who were admitted as beginning freshmen at Illinois State University, who were readmitted and who have not completed a baccalaureate-oriented associate’s degree (A.A. or A.S.—the A.S. must include the complete IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) package) from an Illinois public community college and are not eligible for an earlier catalog.

2. Complete the Illinois General Education Core Curriculum package available through the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI).
View ISU courses that satisfy the IAI General Education Core Curriculum package
This program is a statewide agreement between participating public colleges and universities and some private schools that is designed to facilitate timely degree completion for students who transfer between institutions. The Illinois Transferable General Education Core Curriculum Package structure consists of 12 to 13 courses (37 to 41 semester credits) distributed among five subject areas. Completion of these courses at any participating institution satisfies general education requirements for Illinois State University. The IAI GECC Package is presented in the section entitled General Education - Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI). More information about this system and participating institutions can be found at iTransfer.org. 
The following categories of students may complete the Illinois General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) package:
Transfer students (See Admissions section of this catalog for a complete description) who began the Illinois General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) at a participating IAI institution and transferred to Illinois State may choose to complete the program by enrolling in Illinois State approved IAI courses presented in the section entitled Illinois Articulation Initiative Courses at Illinois State. Transfer students should note, however, that IAI course availability may be limited.
Transfer students who have completed at least one transfer course that is articulated to an IAI General Education Core Curriculum requirement.
Students who have completed the Illinois General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) package at a participating IAI institution are considered to have met Illinois State University's General Education requirements.
3. 
 Complete a baccalaureate-oriented Associates Degree (A.A. or A.S.) from a regionally accredited post-secondary institution.
For those transferring from an 
Illinois college or university, the A.S. degree must include the complete IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) package or the student must complete the IAI GECC package to fulfill Illinois State’s General Education requirement.
Any transfer student may choose to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program and should speak with an academic advisor regarding documentation of that change on their academic record.

The MBA degree assumes an undergraduate knowledge base in business and economics which students with undergraduate degrees in business will normally have acquired.
Students admitted with nonbusiness undergraduate degrees may have to complete Pre-MBA Program courses before enrolling in the MBA core courses. Specific requirements will be determined by the Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Curriculum (hereafter referred to as "Associate Dean"). The responsibility for demonstrating prior academic coverage of the material at the appropriate level rests with the student and should be completed at least one month prior to the beginning of the first semester of course work. Students who have not taken college algebra, economics, accounting, finance, and/or statistics within the past five years are strongly encouraged to take the Pre-MBA Program courses as a refresher prior to their first core course.
Students with a non-business undergraduate degree should expect to complete some or all of the following Pre-MBA Program courses online. 
Fundamentals of Economics 
Financial Accounting
Managerial Accounting 
Principles of Management 
Principles of Marketing 
Business Math and Statistics 
Understanding Corporate Finance 
Business Law Essentials
In addition to any Pre-MBA Program courses required, some or all of which may be waived based on an individual's previous academic work, all MBA candidates must complete one of the following sequences:
Traditional MBA Sequence
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416 
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450; Students who have successfully completed 12 or more undergraduate semester hours in a required core area may be eligible to substitute a 400-level elective in that area for the required core course. 
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485 
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. (Graduate courses at the 300-level may not be taken to fulfill the MBA elective requirements). In consultation with a Master of Business Administration advisor, students can choose from among a wide offering of elective courses to design a Plan of Study. The choice should be congruent with each student's goals. Elective courses are offered based on student demand. Elective courses taken outside the College of Business require prior approval by the Associate Dean and often involve additional course work to fulfill prerequisites.
Corporate MBA Sequence (CMBA)
36 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485
9 hours of 400-level graduate business or other pre-approved elective courses. The CMBA is a cohort program. Students vote to choose which three electives the cohort will take.
Panama MBA Sequence
42 semester hours required:
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416
18 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450, BIS 468;

						STEM MBA
Degree Offered: MBA
The STEM MBA degree is designed to give students a technology and analytics focused business education at the graduate level. The degree includes grounding in all functional and strategic aspects of business with an emphasis on business analytics, data analytics, data science, management science, technology and innovation management, statistical modelling, operations analysis, data mining, business forecasting, and quality management.
Required Credit Hours: 36
9 hours of beginning skill core courses: MBA 411, MBA 412, MBA 416
15 hours of central core courses: MBA 421, MBA 427, MBA 430, MBA 440, MBA 450 
3 hour capstone course: MBA 485

Course Limitations
No more than a total of three (3) credits can be counted from any 400 (Independent Study) and 498 (Internship) courses. Exceptions must be approved by the Associate Dean. Credit will not be given for course numbers below 400 (no 300-level graduate course will be counted in a Traditional or Corporate MBA Plan of Study). All core and elective courses must be completed within six years from the time of taking the first core course.
Credit-Hour Limitations for Non-Business Graduate Students
While other graduate programs on campus may require and/or give elective credit for selected MBA courses, non-MBA graduate students will not be permitted to exceed 12 credit hours of MBA course work. Non-business students seeking to enroll in MBA courses will first need to obtain their major advisor’s permission to register for classes and then must submit to the MBA Office an online override request form. Permission to enroll is dependent upon space availability in the requested course(s) and prior completion of prerequisites. MBA students will have priority in registration.
Courses
Descriptions of courses leading to the MBA degree are found under the Departments of Finance, Insurance and Law; Management; Marketing; Accounting; and Master of Business Administration.
Repetition of Courses in the MBA Program
A student may register officially for an MBA course (core or elective) only twice. A student who completes a course or drops a course after census day (the tenth day of the semester) may officially enroll in the same course only one additional time.

Our hometown got its name from “Illinois State Normal University,” our old moniker. Back then, we were a teachers’ college and “normal” meant teaching.

Shared Governance
Illinois State University takes great pride in shared governance. The University recognizes that for the institution to operate effectively the voices of administrators, faculty, staff, and students need to be heard and that optimal solutions often come from the results of these groups collaborating. University governing bodies – Board of Trustees, Academic Senate, Administrative/Professional Council, Civil Service Council, and Student Government Association—represent the constituencies of the University and form the formal structure for shared governance.
Board of Trustees
The governance of Illinois State University is vested by law in the Board of Trustees. Within the limits set by the State Constitution and the federal and state laws, the Board of Trustees is the final authority in all matters affecting the institution, and it exercises jurisdiction over the institution's financial, educational, and other policies and its relation with the state and federal governments. 
View the Board of Trustees
Academic Senate
The Academic Senate is the primary governing body that recommends educational policy for the University and advises the President on its implementation. Members of the Academic Senate are elected by their constituencies and include faculty, staff, and students.
View the Academic Senate
Administrative/Professional Council
The Administrative/Professional Council serves in an advisory capacity to the administration regarding the general welfare of all Administrative/Professional employees.
View the A/P Council
Civil Service Council
The Civil Service Council represents civil service employees and related issues to the administration and advises the administration in the formation and implementation of policies and procedures relating to civil service employees.
View the CS Council
Student Government Association

Complaint Resolution
Complaint Resolution - Illinois State University
Federal regulations require institutions of higher education to publish contact information for use by students and other parties in filing concerns or complaints. Contacts for concerns or complaints regarding programs and services at Illinois State University are provided below. Links in this document are active; if accessing this document online, click the link to access the linked information. URLs for all links are listed at the end of this document.
Resolving Complaints on the Department/School, College, or Unit Level
The recommended first step in resolving concerns or complaints is to contact the instructor, department or school, college, or student affairs unit at the University responsible for the course, program, or service that is the source of concern or complaint. These are described below by type of concern or complaint.
Academic Concerns
The Code of Student Conduct sets forth policies regarding appropriate academic conduct and describes processes followed when violations of the code are alleged, including, but not limited to, violations of Academic Integrity policies that prohibit plagiarism and other acts of academic dishonesty. Questions regarding the Code of Student Conduct and its enforcement may be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office..
Students are encouraged to contact their instructor first if seeking assistance with a concern regarding a course or academic program, including, but not limited to, an assignment or course grade or the oral English proficiency of an instructor. If the instructor is unable to address the concern, the student may seek assistance from the chairperson or director of the academic department or school through which the course or program is offered. Concerns or complaints not resolved by the department chairperson or school director may be addressed to the dean of the college in which that department or school is administratively located. For a current list of department chairpersons, schools directors, and college deans, see the About page of the Office of the Provost website.
For policies and procedures regarding final course grade challenges, see Final Course Grade Challenge Policy, Final Course Grade Challenge Procedure, and Final Course Grade Challenge Form.
Students enrolled in an online or distance education course or program are encouraged to contact their instructor for academic concerns and the Technology Support Center for problems related to the technology used in the course or program. Concerns that cannot be resolved by the instructor or the Technology Support Center may be addressed to the chairperson of the department or director of the school through which the course or program is offered. Concerns or complaints not resolved by the department chairperson or schools director may be addressed to the dean of the college in which that department or school is administratively located. For a current list of department chairpersons, school directors, and college deans, see the About page of the Office of the Provost website.
Student Affairs Concerns
Concerns or complaints regarding student services, including, but not limited to, campus housing, campus dining services, student health services, student counseling services, and student recreation services, should first be addressed to the supervisor or director responsible for the service or unit. Students needing assistance identifying the appropriate individual or party to whom a concern or complaint should be addressed may contact the Dean of Students Office for guidance. Weekdays between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. questions may also be addressed to the Dean on Duty.
Harassment and Discrimination Concerns
Any concerns regarding alleged harassment or discrimination should be promptly addressed with the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access. OEOA is responsible for implementing complaint policies and procedures set forth in University Policy 1.2: Anti-Harassment and Non-Discrimination Policy and University Policy 1.2.1: AntiHarassment and Non-Discrimination Policy Complaint Procedures.
Student Access and Accommodations Concerns
Concerns or complaints regarding accommodation services for students and guests with disabilities and/or medical/mental health conditions may be directed to Student Access and Accommodation Services, a unit within the Division of Student Affairs.
Concerns Not Resolved on the Department/School, College, or Unit Level
Students unable to resolve concerns through contacts with instructors, department chairpersons, school directors, college deans, or student affairs unit may contact any of the three university administrative offices listed below. Written contacts are recommended, although complaints or concerns may also be filed verbally, either in person or via phone.
For academic concerns:

Office of the PresidentHovey Hall 421Campus Box 1000PH: (309) 438-6577
Concerns Not Resolved at the University Level
Students may also address any concern or complaint regarding any program or service of Illinois State University to the Illinois Board of Higher Education, the state agency responsible for oversight of colleges and universities in Illinois, or to the Higher Learning Commission, the regional entity that accredits Illinois State University. Please note that the staff of either agency may refer any person communicating a concern or complaint not yet communicated to the appropriate unit at Illinois State University back to Illinois State University.
Students enrolled in a distance education program of Illinois State University but residing in a state other than Illinois may also contact the agency in their state responsible for oversight of colleges and universities. For a list of those contacts, consult the NC-SARA website (use the States drop down menu in the navigation bar in the page header).

Illinois State University maintains a small college environment within a large university. We value personal attention for each and every student and our commitment to individuals begins with the recruitment and admission processes.
Illinois State seeks a highly-motivated, academically well-prepared, and diverse student body. Admission to the University is competitive. Applying during the priority filing period is encouraged as the University has the right to limit enrollment due to space availability in major programs and overall student capacity. Please refer to the Admissions website for more information and detailed dates and deadlines. 
Student Types
Beginning Freshman, also known as First Time in College (FTIC)
The following will classify a student as a new beginning freshman (FTIC):
A person who has never attended any college or university since graduating from high school. A student earning college hours while in high school will be classified as a new beginning freshman.
A person who enrolls at any college or university during the summer term immediately following high school graduation and then enrolls during the subsequent fall term at Illinois State University will be classified as a beginning freshman.
A person who graduates early from high school, attends a college or university during the spring term, and begins at Illinois State the following fall will be considered a beginning freshman if the high school transcript lists the graduation date as May or June. 
Transfer Student
The following will classify a student as a transfer student:
1. A person who has enrolled at any college or university after graduating from high school, whether or not any work was completed (except for students who classify as beginning freshmen under number 2 or 3 under the Beginning Freshman section).
2. A person who graduates early from high school and attends a college or university during the spring term and begins at Illinois State the following fall will be considered a transfer student if the high school transcript lists the graduation date as December or January.
Former Illinois State Student/Readmit
A person who wishes to return to Illinois State after not enrolling for one or more semesters, excluding summer, and has not received their bachelor’s degree from another institution while away. 
Non-Degree Visiting Student
A person who does not have a bachelor’s degree and desires to take classes at the University without working toward a degree.
International Student
A person who is neither a United States citizen nor a United States permanent resident and cannot be classified as undocumented.
Undocumented Student
A person who lives in the United States without documentation of U.S. citizenship or legal residency.
Admission Guidelines
The following sections outline the admission guidelines for the student types previously listed. Please note that catalog year does not govern admission requirements to the University or to a specific major. Requirements can change yearly based upon the competitiveness of the applicant pool and the space availability at the University and within each major program. Only graduation requirements are governed by catalog year. 
Program-Specific Admission Criteria
 Illinois State University regulates admission to designated programs when the number of students seeking admission exceeds the available educational resources of the department or school. Specific majors may have additional admission requirements.
Freshman Admission
 Illinois State considers the following when making an admission decision:
Grade point average
SAT or ACT (optional) 
Academic Personal Statement (optional; may be requested based on application review)
Applicants must also show successful completion of the following:
English – 4 years
Mathematics – 3 years; we encourage college readiness courses like algebra, geometry, trigonometry, or fundamentals of computer programming. 
Natural science – 2 years with laboratories
Social science – 2 years
Foreign language or fine arts – 2 years* 
Electives – 2 years
*NOTE: All students in the College of Arts and Sciences must satisfy a foreign language graduation requirement that may be met by: 3 years of the same foreign language in high school or completion of the second semester or higher of college-level foreign language with a passing grade or equivalent proficiency as determined by examination. Students who have completed 1 semester of college foreign language credit may elect to satisfy this requirement by studying abroad in an approved program in a non-English speaking country. American Sign Language may be used to fulfill this requirement by transfer credit or by proficiency.
General Equivalency Diploma in Lieu of High School Diploma
Applicants who use general equivalency diploma (GED) test results in lieu of a high school diploma are required to submit GED test results reflecting the standard of 150 on four tests and a total score of 600 or better. Applicants may also submit SAT or ACT test scores.
Finalizing Admission
Admission decisions are conditional until final transcripts are received and satisfactory completion of courses is confirmed. Admission may be revoked if this information is not verified by the final official transcript(s). If the validity of the transcript or high school diploma is questioned, the Office of Admissions will request documentation from the secondary school that confirms the validity of the student’s diploma. In addition, the Office of Admissions may contact the relevant department or agency in the state in which the secondary school is located to confirm that the secondary school is recognized as a provider of secondary school education. Withholding information or giving false information to the University may make a student ineligible for admission to the University or subject to dismissal.
Transfer Admission
Illinois State considers the following when making admission decisions:
Transfer program requirements:
Good academic standing from last school attended.
If fewer than 24 college semester hours completed at the time of application, high school courses and high school grade point average (SAT or ACT scores are optional)
Proof of high school graduation or passing scores on GED exam, if requested.
Optional: an academic personal statement explaining circumstances that affected collegiate academic performance.
Some programs have cumulative college grade point average and prerequisite coursework
Illinois State requires all students to have a declared major upon completion of 75 hours. Due to this policy, transfer students are encouraged to apply to a major program of study. Transfer students with a high amount of transfer credit will be carefully reviewed and evaluated on a case by case basis for admissibility to the University and to their intended major.
Illinois State University will calculate a cumulative undergraduate grade point average, which will include all courses completed with the exception of developmental (non-credit) coursework. However, for a course repeated at the same college or university, only the highest grade received will be used in calculating the grade point average for admission.
Finalizing Admission
Admission decisions are conditional until final transcripts are received and satisfactory completion of courses is confirmed. Admission may be revoked if this information is not verified by the final official transcript(s). Withholding information or giving false information to the University may make a student ineligible for admission to the University or subject to dismissal.
Transferability of Course Credit
After admission to Illinois State, the Office of the University Registrar will determine how much transfer credit will be given and how it may be used to fulfill Illinois State’s curricular requirements. Transfer credit from community colleges is limited to 70 semester hours; credit from four-year colleges and universities is limited to 90 semester hours. Additional credit for military service may be considered.
Students who have completed an A.A. from any regionally accredited post secondary institution or the Illinois Articulation Initiative General Education Core Curriculum (IAI GECC) at an accredited, participating Illinois college or university will be considered to have met the Illinois State University General Education requirements.
Students who have completed an A.S. from an accredited, participating Illinois college or university must complete the IAI GECC either as part of their A.S. degree or by completing the GECC at ISU or by transfer credit. All distribution requirements of each GECC category must be followed; that is, both a humanities and a fine arts course must be completed and at least two different disciplines must be represented in Social and Behavioral Sciences.
Students who have completed an A.S. from any regionally accredited post-secondary institution outside the state of Illinois will be considered to have met the Illinois State University General Education requirements.
Students completing an A.A. or A.S. will also have junior class standing. Illinois State University accepts the AAT degree as a baccalaureate-oriented degree when the AAT degree includes the IAI transferable core.
Transfer students who transfer credit from participating Illinois colleges or universities that satisfies some but not all requirements of the IAI GECC may satisfy Illinois State General Education requirements by completing requirements for the IAI GECC at Illinois State or by completing the University’s own General Education program. Other students must complete Illinois State’s General Education program.
Illinois State generally accepts transfer courses with earned grades of D. However, certain courses in some major programs may require a grade of C or better. When a student who pursues one of these majors transfers D grade course credit that is equated to an Illinois State course requiring a grade of C or better, the student will have to repeat the course to satisfy the major program requirements.
Second Bachelor’s Degree
A student who has already received one bachelor’s degree may receive a second bachelor’s degree at Illinois State University upon completion of degree requirements. Students must meet the admission requirements for the major selected and meet appropriate deadlines. All college-level undergraduate coursework will be taken into consideration when computing an overall GPA for evaluation.
Second bachelor degree seeking students are required to fulfill degree requirements as listed in the catalog at the time of admission to the second bachelor degree program. The program of studies completed for the second degree must include at least 32 semester hours of coursework taken after the granting of the first degree, of which 30 hours must be taken in residence at Illinois State. At least 24 of the 32 hours completed toward the second degree must be at senior college-level (courses numbered 200 and above).
Former Illinois State Students Seeking Readmission
Students who have been absent from the University for one or more semesters must apply for readmission. Early application is encouraged as it may not be possible to offer readmission for the term requested due to space limitations. Readmitted students should consult the section on Undergraduate Catalog Requirements to determine which catalog should be used to determine graduation requirements.
Illinois State considers the following when making decisions on readmission:
Students must have left Illinois State University in good academic standing.
If coursework is completed since leaving Illinois State, a minimum 2.00 GPA is required for all college coursework completed and good academic standing must be shown from the last institution attended. Please note that many majors require higher GPA standards and prerequisite college coursework for admission. The student’s Illinois State University GPA is used to determine eligibility for any new major.
View the admission requirements for specific majors.
If on probation or dismissed, students may be considered for reinstatement or for the New Start readmission program. Supplemental information may be requested to determine eligibility.
Learn more about these readmission options.
If dismissed for disciplinary reasons, students should contact the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution for disciplinary clearance. Readmission cannot be considered until clearance is given.
New Start Policy
Students who leave Illinois State in a degree program with less than a 2.00 cumulative grade-point average (GPA) may be considered for readmission through the New Start Policy. Applicants admitted through this policy will begin with a new cumulative GPA calculated from the point of their reentry.
Students may be considered for readmission through the New Start Policy after being away from the University for one full year (example: a student who last attended the University during the fall 2016 term may not be considered for reenrollment through the New Start Policy until the spring 2018 term) and only when the requirements of one of the following New Start categories are met: Nontraditional Student, Veteran, or Community College Transfer.
Students may exercise the New Start policy only once. Such students will have “New Start” indicated on their transcript. New Start will affect only the cumulative GPA and eligibility for graduation honors. All grades earned at Illinois State, regardless of when earned, will be used in the calculation of the major GPA, the minor GPA, and for Satisfactory Academic Progress calculation for financial aid eligibility. 
Students who are admitted through the New Start Policy will be admitted on academic probation and be required to participate in Project Success (see the Academic Policies and Practices section for further information). Students who reenter under the New Start Policy must follow the Undergraduate Catalog in effect at the time of reentry. To be eligible for graduation, a student must earn at least 30 semester hours at Illinois State University after exercising New Start.
Visiting Student/Unclassified Admission
Individuals desiring to take a class or classes at Illinois State as a visitor without working toward a specific degree at Illinois State may be admitted as non-degree seeking students. Applicants may be required to provide evidence showing prerequisite background for the course(s) desired. Non-degree students must maintain the same standard of performance as degree-seeking students. Visiting students who wish to become candidates for a degree at some later time must apply for admission as a degree seeking student and must meet published requirements for admission into the desired program. There is no guarantee that courses taken as a visiting student will count towards a degree should the student be admitted into a degree program in the future. Additionally, some courses at Illinois State are only available to students in specific majors, so there is no guarantee of course availability. Students who hold a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university are not eligible for the unclassified undergraduate status. 
International Student Admission
Freshmen Admission:
Illinois State considers the following when making an admission decision:
Grade point average
English proficiency
Applicants must also earn the equivalent of a U.S. high school diploma from a recognized international institution of secondary or high school level, or will do so prior to enrollment.
English as a Second Language
Illinois State University's Office of International Engagement offers the Academic English, International Year One, and Graduate Pathway programs for international students to improve their English language comprehension while preparing them to be successful, degree-seeking students at the University.
Transfer Admission
Transfer program requirements:
Good academic standing from last school attended
If fewer than 24 college semester hours are completed at the time of application, high school grade point average
English proficiency
Some programs have cumulative college grade point average and prerequisite coursework
Illinois State requires all students to have a declared major upon completion of 75 hours. Due to this policy, transfer students are encouraged to apply to a major program of study. Transfer students with a high amount of transfer credit will be carefully reviewed and evaluated on a case by case basis for admissibility to the University and to their intended major.
Upon receipt of all necessary materials, the Office of International Admissions will review the application file for an admission decision. Students who are admitted and submit federally required financial documentation will be sent a Certificate of Eligibility (I-20) for Non-immigrant (F-1) student status.
Eligibility:
International students must:
Demonstrate English proficiency by meeting our English Proficiency Guidelines 
Submit a declaration of finances showing source of support and official documentation of funds available for the first year’s expenses. Financial proof is required for all students seeking F-1 status.
International applicants who meet all other academic criteria for admission but whose scores do not meet the minimum standards for English proficiency may be admitted to a degree program. In such cases, students will be required to attend courses in the Academic English program at their own expense and remain in the program until their English proficiency has improved to a level required for University enrollment.
Finalizing Admission
Admission decisions are conditional until final transcripts and other supporting documents are received.
Withholding information or giving false information to the University may make a student ineligible for admission to the University or subject to dismissal. 
Special Admission Programs
The University may admit a limited number of applicants who show the potential for success in collegiate work but who do not meet all the regular admission standards.
The special admissions programs are as follows:
Adult Learner Program
All persons 25 years of age or older prior to the first day of class for any given semester, who hold a high school diploma or General Equivalency Diploma, may be considered for admission as an Adult Learner. Admission as an Adult Learner is an unclassified/non-degree seeking student status. If attendance at a college or university has been within two years of anticipated enrollment, students must submit transcripts indicating a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 on a 4.00 scale and be in good standing at the last school attended. Adult Learners who, at some later time, wish to become candidates for a degree must complete a minimum of 12 semester hours at Illinois State, apply for admission as a degree seeking student, and meet university admission requirements for the desired program. A student's Illinois State Adult Learner GPA is used in determining admission to desired major, along with other course prerequisites. 
Concurrent Admissions Program (ConAp) for Army and Army Reserve Enlistees
The Concurrent Admission Program (ConAp) is a partnership between the Army Recruiting Command and over 1,900 participating colleges to mutually advance the goals of lifelong learning and postsecondary education for Future Soldiers. This program allows individuals enlisting in the Army or Army Reserve who are part of the Future Soldier program to declare their intent to enroll at a college or university at the time of their enlistment. The Future Soldier submits a College Referral and Intent to Enroll form to a ConAp college stating his/her intent to enroll during or after their enlistment. The college acknowledges the intent to enroll form and sends information about the college to the Future Soldier. 
The ConAp form provides guidelines about applying for admission, preparing for the academic experience, beginning college work during enlistment, and staying in touch with the college. Please note that individuals must apply to Illinois State by using the standard application process, and individuals must meet admission requirements in effect at the time of their enrollment. In addition, a DD214 showing honorable discharge is required as part of the application process.
Dual Enrollment Program
Offers qualified high school students an opportunity to take college-level classes. Dual Enrollment students are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If admitted, they are given unclassified student status and are advised by University College. They cannot be full-time students while still in high school and must take classes offered on campus.
Talent Program
Applicants who demonstrate an outstanding talent in art, music, theatre, dance, forensics, or athletics.
Veterans Program
Applicants who were Illinois residents at the time of entrance into the Armed Forces, who present a discharge for other than dishonorable reasons showing completion of at least a one-year active tour of duty in the Armed Forces, and whose first attendance at a college or university after discharge is at Illinois State can be considered for admission through this program.

Criminal Activity and Disciplinary Disclosure
Illinois State University is committed to maintaining a safe and positive environment for all members of the University community. Therefore, at the time of application, applicants will be required to disclose information regarding criminal background. In addition, applicants must report misconduct that resulted in disciplinary separation from a previous school or university. These cases will be reviewed by the University prior to an admission decision being made. Such disclosure does not automatically disqualify an applicant. For additional information, please contact the Office of Admissions.
Fraudulent Documents [HA1]
All documents and information submitted to the University are required to be true, accurate, and complete and the submission of documents that are forged, fraudulent, altered from the original, materially incomplete, obtained under false pretenses, or otherwise deceptive is prohibited as is the submission of information that is inaccurate or misleading, whether by act or omission. Further, it is the applicant's responsibility to notify the Office of Admissions of any changes to submitted application documentation and information. 
Submission of fraudulent documents or information in the admission process shall automatically invalidate the application to Illinois State university and be grounds for revocation of admission and/or a temporary or permanent ban on future admission. 
Immunization and Medical Requirements for all Students
All Illinois State University students are required, by College Immunization Code (77 III.Adm.Code 694), to provide documentation of the following:

These academic courses progress from introducing the student to the Army’s mission and organization, studying leadership principles and traits, to teaching students the duties and responsibilities required of officers in the twenty-first century. Each class has a leadership laboratory that meets once a week. At lab, freshmen through senior students train on basic military skills and receive the opportunity to develop leadership skills through hands-on application. Some of the skills learned during lab include rappelling, water survival training, rifle marksmanship, first aid and CPR, map reading and land navigation, and basic tactics.
Enrolled students in the ROTC program will also have the opportunity to compete for and participate in cultural exchange programs, military internships, and professional internships with several government agencies in the varying fields such as criminal justice, nursing, and information technology.  In addition to regular on-campus training and activities, ROTC offers exciting and challenging weekend field training exercises during the school year. Trips include a staff ride, an orientation visit to Fort Knox, Kentucky, and trips to local National Guard training areas to practice marksmanship, land navigation, and tactical skills.
Financial Aid
Military Science students can receive outstanding financial aid through Federal and State Army ROTC scholarships. Federal ROTC scholarships are awarded for a four, three, or two-year period. Students compete at the national level for these scholarships. Each scholarship can pay up to the full tuition and fees each semester, provides a book allowance of $1,200 a year, and a tax free monthly living allowance of $420, depending on scholarship status. 
State ROTC tuition waivers are awarded by the Professor of Military Science at Illinois State University. The Redbird Battalion awards up to forty of these scholarships each semester to students in the ROTC program. 
Extracurricular Activities
Several clubs complement the ROTC academic curriculum, and help students enjoy their college experience more.  Ranger Club trains intensively on military skills such as land navigation, patrolling, and rappelling. They sponsor the annual Ranger Challenge competition in which a group of ten cadets are tested on individual and team military skills. The Illinois State University Ranger Challenge team competes with other university ROTC Ranger Challenge teams from around the geographical region in an intercollegiate competition.
Rifle Club fires .22 caliber and precision air rifles weekly at an indoor rifle range. They also participate in marksmanship competitions with other university ROTC programs during the school year, with the opportunity to compete at the National Collegiate level.
The Redbird Color Guard presents the national colors at home football and basketball games, as well as other local community events.
Career Opportunities
Students who complete the ROTC program receive a commission as a second lieutenant in the Army after graduation. The student has the option of serving in the National Guard or Army Reserve as a part time career, or on active duty in the Regular Army as a full time profession. ROTC graduates can also receive a minor in Military Science by applying through the Military Science Department.
Lieutenants in the Army lead soldiers, while managing equipment, vehicle fleets, and financial resources. New lieutenants are routinely put in charge of and lead groups of up to fifty soldiers shortly after college graduation.
Officer career specialties in the Army are as diverse as those found in the civilian sector. Some of the seventeen specialties students can request as an Army officer include: Aviation, Cyber, Engineering, Finance, Medical Service Corps, Military Intelligence, Military Police, Nursing, Personnel Management, Signal, or Transportation. Except for Nursing, an officer’s specialty in the Army does not have to be related to his or her academic degree in college.
New lieutenants who go into the Regular Army serve on Active Duty for four years, and may then transfer into the Reserve Component. Lieutenants commissioned in the National Guard or Army Reserve will serve their entire eight year obligation in the Reserves.
Minor in Military Science
Admission into the Military Science Minor program is by permission of the Department Chairperson following a special interview concerning eligibility and entry requirements. Interested students should make arrangements for an interview as early as possible but not later than the second semester of their sophomore year.

All master's degree programs require a minimum of 50 percent of the non-thesis credit hours applied to the degree to be 400-level courses or above.
Academic Advisors
An advisory committee will be assigned upon admission. The School Director, in consultation with the student and faculty whom the Director deems appropriate, will select the candidate's portfolio committee. The portfolio committee chair must come from the student's studio area.
Transfer Credit
A student who does not have an earned master's degree usually may present no more than six semester hours of credit from another college or university for use in meeting the requirements of the M.F.A. degree. However, a student may present all earned hours from an M.A./M.S. program in Theatre Studies at Illinois State University for use in meeting these requirements.
The total hours required for a student with an earned master's degree will be based on an evaluation of the student's portfolio and academic record. However, the final determination will not be made until the student has completed a minimum of six semester hours in his/her major area of emphasis. The student's M.F.A. committee will supervise all evaluations. Refer to M.F.A. Transfer Credit in the Fields of Study and Degrees Granted section.
A minimum of 32 hours must be taken at Illinois State University
Residency Requirement
A student without an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least four semesters with at least two of them being full-time, consecutive semesters. A student with an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least two full-time, consecutive semesters. Summer session may be counted toward the two consecutive semester requirement.
The M.F.A. Portfolio
Each semester of enrollment the M.F.A. candidate will enroll in THE 501, M.F.A. Portfolio, for one hour credit. The portfolio is the backbone of the Master of Fine Arts program. It is designed to ensure the regular and systematic evaluation of the student's progress. The portfolio is a collection of materials, including examples of the student's work where appropriate, reviews, evaluations and other artifacts, which may record or characterize the student's experience in the program. The portfolio also contains the student's responses to evaluations as well as statements from the Portfolio Committee which provide direction for the student's future work in the program.
The student must have a portfolio evaluation for each full semester he or she is in the program. The written results of that evaluation are included in the portfolio. The portfolio provides a cumulative record of the student's progress which is carried over from semester to semester.
Finally, the portfolio, with its record of the student's activities in the program, provides the major objective basis for awarding the degree. Although the student may engage in major creative projects during his or her program, the portfolio stands in lieu of the traditional thesis or creative thesis project which is the culminating experience in many programs.
Qualifying/Comprehensive Examination
A qualifying examination is required prior to the exit portfolio presentation. It may be comprehensive to the extent that it examines the candidate's knowledge of the discipline of theatre; it may include graduate work the student is presenting for the degree; and it may include demonstration of proficiency. The examination will be conducted by the student's M.F.A. Portfolio Committee. The student may request that other faculty members with whom he/she has taken course work participate in the qualifying examination.
Final Portfolio Review and Exit Interview
To be eligible for the exit portfolio presentation, the student must (1) present a grade average of B or better with not more than six (6) hours of a grade of C; (2) have completed (or will complete in the current semester) two semesters of full-time resident study; (3) have a degree audit on file with the Graduate School; (4) have passed a qualifying examination; and (5) pass a final portfolio review and exit to be conducted by his/her M.F.A. Committee. The format of this review and exit will be determined by the M.F.A. Committee, who will, when the work is deemed satisfactory, recommend the student to the appropriate studio area for graduation. At least one week before the Graduate School graduation notification deadline, the School Graduate Faculty will meet to hear the studio area's recommendations. Once the Graduate Faculty has approved the student's graduation, the student will be recommended to the Graduate School for the granting of the degree.
Students should consult with their M.F.A. Portfolio Committees and the School Graduate Advisor for details and the calendar of the final portfolio review and exit. While no student is guaranteed graduation, those whose work is deemed unsatisfactory may be presented opportunities for remediation by their Portfolio Committees.

Paralegals may not provide legal services directly to the public except as permitted by law.
Admission to the Legal Studies major is limited and based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: courses completed, cumulative GPA, hours completed, personal interview or written statement, and samples of work completed.

 In order to gain admission into the Legal Studies minor, a student must have completed at least two (2) Legal Studies courses (one of which must be LGS 201); and must have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 2.50 in those two Legal Studies courses.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies.

Minor in Global Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The minor in Global Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to enrich development of students as global citizens, and to prepare them for navigating an increasingly dynamic, complex and interconnected world. The minor helps students develop a global vision by promoting awareness of significant political, economic, and social interactions and impacts of those on the world. Critically examining contemporary global issues, events, processes and trends from multiple perspectives will improve adaptability and innovative problem solving, and prepare students for careers in public, private, and non-profit organizations where global knowledge, skills and commitment to diversity and sustainability matters. At the same time, a global education can help students develop greater self-awareness of their own identities and how they are connected to the larger world. The minor is highly individualized and can be tailored to enhance many major fields of study and other minor programs.

Admission/Retention Requirements
All incoming undergraduate students are initially enrolled in the B.A. or B.S. programs, depending on their interests. Those who wish to apply to the B.F.A. program do so no earlier than the first semester during their sophomore year. 
The School of Art expects regular class attendance and supports faculty members who choose to reduce course grades for lack of participation, including excessive absences.
Students seeking admission to the Major in Art must comply with criteria established by the School of Art, including submission of a portfolio of work for review by the School. Students interested in the Art History Sequence will submit a statement explaining their interest in the field, in lieu of the portfolio. Specific requirements for the portfolio and statement may be obtained from the School office.
To graduate with a Major in Art (B.A., B.S.) students must complete all requirements of one of the School of Art’s Sequences: Studio Arts, Graphic Design, Art History, or Teacher Education. They must also earn grades of C or better and maintain a 2.50 GPA in all courses taken in the School of Art, in addition to maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00. Individual sequences may have higher requirements. Courses in the Major may be repeated no more than once for the purpose of attaining the necessary minimum grade. Students may not enroll for the next course in a related series until the minimum grade in the prerequisite course is achieved. Incoming transfer students must retake courses considered equivalents to courses in the Major for which they earned lower than a grade of C. Students who do not meet these criteria will be placed on probation with the School of Art; a student placed on probation more than once will be dropped from the School.
Admission to some Sequences in Art may be restricted by the lack of available School resources, especially in times of oversubscription. 
In times of oversubscription and limitations on resources within the School of Art, some Discipline Areas may require faculty screening of students’ supportive materials before allowing individual students to enroll in the second course in that Discipline.
All Sequences in the Major in Art require successful completion of the Art History Core, the Foundations program appropriate to that sequence, a series of courses specific to the chosen sequence, and electives in Art. Students must complete all Sequence Foundations courses before being permitted to continue in one of the sequences in the Art major; gifted students may be allowed to take 200-level courses in their areas of interest during the freshman year, pending approval of the School. Students must also complete all Art History Core courses before they may enroll in 300-level Art History courses.
Students must make every effort to complete the required Foundations courses in their first three semesters in the program. Under most circumstances students will formally declare intention to enter a particular sequence in the Art major by the second semester of the sophomore year. Students will arrange to participate in screening requirements for their preferred sequence; those not accepted into competitive sequences may be reconsidered the following semester and should consult with appropriate faculty for advice before rescreening. Also in the sophomore year, students will begin enrolling in courses appropriate to their sequence of interest. In the case of the Studio Arts Sequence, this also requires declaring a specific Discipline Area in consultation with the School’s academic advisor.
Students can begin to take Graphic Design courses after they have completed the Art History core and Studio Art Foundation courses. There is no portfolio review for admission but students must have and maintain a major and cumulative 2.50 GPA. Students whose cumulative or major GPA falls below 2.50 will not be allowed to register for Graphic Design courses until the GPA has been raised to a 2.50 or higher. Consult the School of Art for further information on admission and retention in the Graphic Design sequence.
Students will be admitted to the Art History Sequence with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 and grades of B or better in ART 155 and ART 156. See the School of Art office for more information. Students will be allowed to continue in the sequence if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 2.50.
All Art majors planning to become licensed teachers must apply for and be admitted to the University Teacher Education program. Grades of C or better in all Art and Education courses, and a 2.50 cumulative and major GPA are required by the Art Teacher Education Area for admission and retention in the Art Teacher Education sequence. Continuation in the Art Teacher Education Sequence is not automatic. Students’ performance will be evaluated each semester.

However, this option is strongly recommended to prepare students for teaching art. Students are also encouraged to take coursework in Urban Education and Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. 
Students may apply to the B.F.A. Degree program beginning in their sophomore year. Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the School of Art for the competitive review that is part of the admission process.

Studio Arts Sequence
The Studio Arts Sequence emphasizes both breadth and depth of competence in Studio-based Art disciplines. It expands students’ horizons beyond the Foundations level with work in a variety of media and disciplines. By requiring intensive study, it develops depth within at least one Studio Discipline Area (ceramics, drawing, glass, intaglio, lithography, metal­work and jewelry design, painting, photography, sculpture, video, wood/metal or expanded media) through the completion of a specific series of courses. It likewise encourages exploration of new genres that break through traditional boundaries between disciplines and media. This sequence prepares students to work as visual arts professionals or pursue graduate studies.

In addition, students may gain professional experience in a graphic design internship. Internships will require a competitive portfolio review.
View Graphic Design Sequence Course Requirements
Art History Sequence
The Art History Sequence provides students a solid grounding in the history of art on both introductory and advanced levels. In addition, the sequence includes exposure to related disciplines outside the visual arts, training in foreign language, and experience in advanced research and writing skills. Together, these requirements prepare students for effective graduate work in Art History or other fields and for positions in a variety of art- and non-art-related fields. 
In special circumstances, students may satisfy the Art History language requirement with a language or languages other than “French, German, Italian or Spanish.” In such cases, the language(s) must be appropriate to the student’s plan of study and career goals. Alternate plans of language study must be approved by the Art History faculty in order to receive credit toward the sequence.
It is recommended that students select electives in courses related to Art History offered by the following departments/schools: Anthropology; English; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; History; Music; Philosophy; Theatre and Dance. Students are encouraged to consult with the Art History faculty for advice on choosing electives in Art History and other departments that will complement their own areas of interests. Faculty are also available for consultation on preparing for graduate school.
Students may combine Art History and Studio by declaring a second Sequence in Studio Arts and fulfilling all requirements for both sequences. This will include submitting a portfolio of art work for admission.
View Art History Sequence Course Requirements
Art Teacher Education Sequence
The Art Teacher Education Sequence is a program that emphasizes a comprehensive approach that supports state and national student learning standards and teaching performance standards in the visual arts. Also stressed are creative and critical thinking, studio techniques, understanding the learner and developing skills to become an effective teacher. Students completing this sequence are eligible to apply for teaching licensure with a K-12 endorsement for teaching art in the State of Illinois.

Languages, Literatures and Cultures
Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language.

The program is not designed to admit students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree.
Students must successfully apply for continuance in the B.S./M.P.A. program in their junior year. Graduate admission would take place after the student has completed approximately 90 hours. Students will be admitted who meet graduate entrance requirements, which include satisfactory performance on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), their previous academic performance, and other evidence of their ability to successfully complete the program. Admission timing is very important to successfully complete the program so students should regularly consult with their Accounting undergraduate or graduate advisor.
Courses completed in the Department of Accounting at this University with grades below C will not count toward the graduation requirements of the Integrated BS/MPA Major, but all grades of D, F, and WX in Accounting courses at this University will be included in computing the cumulative GPA.
Students in the integrated B.S./M.P.A Degrees program must complete one of the following sequences.
Accountancy and Information Systems Sequence
The Accountancy and Information Systems sequence permits students to emphasize study of information systems related to accounting and other business fields.

Master of Athletic Training
Degree Offered: M.A.T.
In addition to requirements for the Graduate School, students must meet all academic and clinical education requirements of the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). The Master of Athletic Training (MAT) degree is a 52 credit hour program and requires both classroom and clinical education. Admission to the academic program is limited and is based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Specific undergraduate prerequisite coursework is required for admission. For a complete list of prerequisite coursework, please refer to the MAT website.
Once admitted, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 on a 4.00 scale throughout the entirety of the program. A student falling below the GPA requirement will be placed on probation for one semester and removed from clinical education. If after one semester the minimum GPA has not been re-established, the student will be dismissed from the program.

Major in Sociology
Sociology majors at Illinois State explore a diverse range of topics and learn to think critically about the social world. Our distinguished faculty members are committed to helping students develop the analytical skills they need to gain a deeper understanding of the world in which we live.
Sociologists look under the surface of social life. They analyze data and develop theories in order to understand and explain social patterns, issues, and problems. Sociology not only helps us understand the roots of these issues and problems, but can also help inform policies that contribute to their solutions.
View Sociology Course Requirements
Minor in Sociology
18 total credit hours in Sociology required

SOC 106
15 credit hours of electives, 9 credit hours must be at the 200- or 300-level.

Anthropology
Degree Offered: B.A., B.S.
Major in Anthropology
Anthropology is a discipline concerned with people in their entirety: our evolution and physical variation, the remnants of our prehistoric past, the cultural and linguistic diversity of human societies past and present.
Anthropology has four subfields: archaeology, anthropological linguistics, cultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. An anthropological education begins with learning the fundamentals. This means taking courses representative of all four subfields.
Students in the Anthropology major must complete one of the following sequences.
Anthropology Sequence
View Anthropology Course Requirements
Accelerated Anthropology Sequence
View Accelerated Anthropology Course Requirements
Program Admission Requirements
The Accelerated Anthropology Sequence (AAS) is a pathway to the Master’s Program in Anthropology. Accelerated degree programs offer high-achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor’s degree and master’s degree with one additional year of study. Students accepted to the sequence will be allowed to take courses during their senior year that will count toward both the undergraduate and graduate programs in anthropology. Qualifying students must apply to the AAS in the spring semester of their junior year. Admission is based on space availability and competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures and deadlines are available on the Anthropology Program website.
Acceptance into the AAS constitutes acceptance into the Master’s Program in Anthropology and thus students will take up to 12 hours of graduate-level credits during their senior year. To transfer to graduate-only status for their second year, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the Master’s Program in Anthropology in the spring of their senior year. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing and have made good progress towards their M.A. degree during their senior year.
A maximum of 12 of the total 15 hours of elective courses may be taken for graduate credit
Some 300-level courses are offered for undergraduate or graduate credit. Students in the Accelerated Sequence who want to count a 300-level course toward their 12 hours of required graduate coursework, must enroll in the 300-level course for graduate credit at the beginning of the course in order for it to count.
To graduate in this sequence, a student must take at least one course for graduate credit during the senior year. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure approval.
Notes
The following anthropology courses may be taken by anthropology majors to fulfill General Education requirements but do not count towards electives for the major: ANT 143, ANT 176, ANT 197
All anthropology majors are encouraged to take SOC 275 (Social Statistics) as part of their undergraduate curriculum, however no Sociology courses may be counted toward the 40 hours in Anthropology required for the major
Special topics courses (ANT 306 and ANT 383) vary from semester to semester may be taken twice for credit if the content is different.
All Graduate School admission deadlines and policies apply to courses for graduate credit
Minor in Anthropology
18 total credit hours in Anthropology required
Required courses
ANT 102
ANT 185

Illinois State University maintains a small college environment within a large university. We value personal attention for each and every student and our commitment to individuals begins with the recruitment and admission processes.
Illinois State seeks a highly-motivated, academically well-prepared, and diverse student body. Admission to the University is competitive.

Admission Guidelines
The following sections outline the admission guidelines for the student types previously listed. Please note that catalog year does not govern admission requirements to the University or to a specific major. Requirements can change yearly based upon the competitiveness of the applicant pool and the space availability at the University and within each major program. Only graduation requirements are governed by catalog year. 
Program-Specific Admission Criteria
 Illinois State University regulates admission to designated programs when the number of students seeking admission exceeds the available educational resources of the department or school. Specific majors may have additional admission requirements.
Freshman Admission
 Illinois State considers the following when making an admission decision:
Grade point average
SAT or ACT (optional) 
Academic Personal Statement (optional; may be requested based on application review)
Applicants must also show successful completion of the following:
English – 4 years
Mathematics – 3 years; we encourage college readiness courses like algebra, geometry, trigonometry, or fundamentals of computer programming. 
Natural science – 2 years with laboratories
Social science – 2 years
Foreign language or fine arts – 2 years* 
Electives – 2 years
*NOTE: All students in the College of Arts and Sciences must satisfy a foreign language graduation requirement that may be met by: 3 years of the same foreign language in high school or completion of the second semester or higher of college-level foreign language with a passing grade or equivalent proficiency as determined by examination. Students who have completed 1 semester of college foreign language credit may elect to satisfy this requirement by studying abroad in an approved program in a non-English speaking country. American Sign Language may be used to fulfill this requirement by transfer credit or by proficiency.
General Equivalency Diploma in Lieu of High School Diploma
Applicants who use general equivalency diploma (GED) test results in lieu of a high school diploma are required to submit GED test results reflecting the standard of 150 on four tests and a total score of 600 or better. Applicants may also submit SAT or ACT test scores.
Finalizing Admission
Admission decisions are conditional until final transcripts are received and satisfactory completion of courses is confirmed. Admission may be revoked if this information is not verified by the final official transcript(s). If the validity of the transcript or high school diploma is questioned, the Office of Admissions will request documentation from the secondary school that confirms the validity of the student’s diploma. In addition, the Office of Admissions may contact the relevant department or agency in the state in which the secondary school is located to confirm that the secondary school is recognized as a provider of secondary school education. Withholding information or giving false information to the University may make a student ineligible for admission to the University or subject to dismissal.
Transfer Admission
Illinois State considers the following when making admission decisions:
Transfer program requirements:
Good academic standing from last school attended.
If fewer than 24 college semester hours completed at the time of application, high school courses and high school grade point average (SAT or ACT scores are optional)
Proof of high school graduation or passing scores on GED exam, if requested.
Optional: an academic personal statement explaining circumstances that affected collegiate academic performance.
Some programs have cumulative college grade point average and prerequisite coursework
Illinois State requires all students to have a declared major upon completion of 75 hours. Due to this policy, transfer students are encouraged to apply to a major program of study. Transfer students with a high amount of transfer credit will be carefully reviewed and evaluated on a case by case basis for admissibility to the University and to their intended major.
Illinois State University will calculate a cumulative undergraduate grade point average, which will include all courses completed with the exception of developmental (non-credit) coursework. However, for a course repeated at the same college or university, only the highest grade received will be used in calculating the grade point average for admission.
Finalizing Admission
Admission decisions are conditional until final transcripts are received and satisfactory completion of courses is confirmed. Admission may be revoked if this information is not verified by the final official transcript(s). Withholding information or giving false information to the University may make a student ineligible for admission to the University or subject to dismissal.
Transferability of Course Credit
After admission to Illinois State, the Office of the University Registrar will determine how much transfer credit will be given and how it may be used to fulfill Illinois State’s curricular requirements. Transfer credit from community colleges is limited to 70 semester hours; credit from four-year colleges and universities is limited to 90 semester hours. Additional credit for military service may be considered.
Students who have completed an A.A. from any regionally accredited post secondary institution or the Illinois Articulation Initiative General Education Core Curriculum (IAI GECC) at an accredited, participating Illinois college or university will be considered to have met the Illinois State University General Education requirements.
Students who have completed an A.S. from an accredited, participating Illinois college or university must complete the IAI GECC either as part of their A.S. degree or by completing the GECC at ISU or by transfer credit. All distribution requirements of each GECC category must be followed; that is, both a humanities and a fine arts course must be completed and at least two different disciplines must be represented in Social and Behavioral Sciences.
Students who have completed an A.S. from any regionally accredited post-secondary institution outside the state of Illinois will be considered to have met the Illinois State University General Education requirements.
Students completing an A.A. or A.S. will also have junior class standing. Illinois State University accepts the AAT degree as a baccalaureate-oriented degree when the AAT degree includes the IAI transferable core.
Transfer students who transfer credit from participating Illinois colleges or universities that satisfies some but not all requirements of the IAI GECC may satisfy Illinois State General Education requirements by completing requirements for the IAI GECC at Illinois State or by completing the University’s own General Education program. Other students must complete Illinois State’s General Education program.
Illinois State generally accepts transfer courses with earned grades of D. However, certain courses in some major programs may require a grade of C or better. When a student who pursues one of these majors transfers D grade course credit that is equated to an Illinois State course requiring a grade of C or better, the student will have to repeat the course to satisfy the major program requirements.
Second Bachelor’s Degree
A student who has already received one bachelor’s degree may receive a second bachelor’s degree at Illinois State University upon completion of degree requirements. Students must meet the admission requirements for the major selected and meet appropriate deadlines. All college-level undergraduate coursework will be taken into consideration when computing an overall GPA for evaluation.
Second bachelor degree seeking students are required to fulfill degree requirements as listed in the catalog at the time of admission to the second bachelor degree program. The program of studies completed for the second degree must include at least 32 semester hours of coursework taken after the granting of the first degree, of which 30 hours must be taken in residence at Illinois State. At least 24 of the 32 hours completed toward the second degree must be at senior college-level (courses numbered 200 and above).
Former Illinois State Students Seeking Readmission
Students who have been absent from the University for one or more semesters must apply for readmission. Early application is encouraged as it may not be possible to offer readmission for the term requested due to space limitations. Readmitted students should consult the section on Undergraduate Catalog Requirements to determine which catalog should be used to determine graduation requirements.
Illinois State considers the following when making decisions on readmission:
Students must have left Illinois State University in good academic standing.
If coursework is completed since leaving Illinois State, a minimum 2.00 GPA is required for all college coursework completed and good academic standing must be shown from the last institution attended. Please note that many majors require higher GPA standards and prerequisite college coursework for admission. The student’s Illinois State University GPA is used to determine eligibility for any new major.
View the admission requirements for specific majors.
If on probation or dismissed, students may be considered for reinstatement or for the New Start readmission program. Supplemental information may be requested to determine eligibility.
Learn more about these readmission options.
If dismissed for disciplinary reasons, students should contact the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution for disciplinary clearance. Readmission cannot be considered until clearance is given.
New Start Policy
Students who leave Illinois State in a degree program with less than a 2.00 cumulative grade-point average (GPA) may be considered for readmission through the New Start Policy. Applicants admitted through this policy will begin with a new cumulative GPA calculated from the point of their reentry.
Students may be considered for readmission through the New Start Policy after being away from the University for one full year (example: a student who last attended the University during the fall 2016 term may not be considered for reenrollment through the New Start Policy until the spring 2018 term) and only when the requirements of one of the following New Start categories are met: Nontraditional Student, Veteran, or Community College Transfer.
Students may exercise the New Start policy only once. Such students will have “New Start” indicated on their transcript. New Start will affect only the cumulative GPA and eligibility for graduation honors. All grades earned at Illinois State, regardless of when earned, will be used in the calculation of the major GPA, the minor GPA, and for Satisfactory Academic Progress calculation for financial aid eligibility. 
Students who are admitted through the New Start Policy will be admitted on academic probation and be required to participate in Project Success (see the Academic Policies and Practices section for further information). Students who reenter under the New Start Policy must follow the Undergraduate Catalog in effect at the time of reentry. To be eligible for graduation, a student must earn at least 30 semester hours at Illinois State University after exercising New Start.
Visiting Student/Unclassified Admission
Individuals desiring to take a class or classes at Illinois State as a visitor without working toward a specific degree at Illinois State may be admitted as non-degree seeking students. Applicants may be required to provide evidence showing prerequisite background for the course(s) desired. Non-degree students must maintain the same standard of performance as degree-seeking students. Visiting students who wish to become candidates for a degree at some later time must apply for admission as a degree seeking student and must meet published requirements for admission into the desired program. There is no guarantee that courses taken as a visiting student will count towards a degree should the student be admitted into a degree program in the future. Additionally, some courses at Illinois State are only available to students in specific majors, so there is no guarantee of course availability. Students who hold a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university are not eligible for the unclassified undergraduate status. 
International Student Admission
Freshmen Admission:
Illinois State considers the following when making an admission decision:
Grade point average
English proficiency
Applicants must also earn the equivalent of a U.S. high school diploma from a recognized international institution of secondary or high school level, or will do so prior to enrollment.
English as a Second Language
Illinois State University's Office of International Engagement offers the Academic English, International Year One, and Graduate Pathway programs for international students to improve their English language comprehension while preparing them to be successful, degree-seeking students at the University.
Transfer Admission
Transfer program requirements:
Good academic standing from last school attended
If fewer than 24 college semester hours are completed at the time of application, high school grade point average
English proficiency
Some programs have cumulative college grade point average and prerequisite coursework
Illinois State requires all students to have a declared major upon completion of 75 hours. Due to this policy, transfer students are encouraged to apply to a major program of study. Transfer students with a high amount of transfer credit will be carefully reviewed and evaluated on a case by case basis for admissibility to the University and to their intended major.
Upon receipt of all necessary materials, the Office of International Admissions will review the application file for an admission decision. Students who are admitted and submit federally required financial documentation will be sent a Certificate of Eligibility (I-20) for Non-immigrant (F-1) student status.
Eligibility:
International students must:
Demonstrate English proficiency by meeting our English Proficiency Guidelines 
Submit a declaration of finances showing source of support and official documentation of funds available for the first year’s expenses. Financial proof is required for all students seeking F-1 status.
International applicants who meet all other academic criteria for admission but whose scores do not meet the minimum standards for English proficiency may be admitted to a degree program. In such cases, students will be required to attend courses in the Academic English program at their own expense and remain in the program until their English proficiency has improved to a level required for University enrollment.
Finalizing Admission
Admission decisions are conditional until final transcripts and other supporting documents are received.
Withholding information or giving false information to the University may make a student ineligible for admission to the University or subject to dismissal. 
Special Admission Programs
The University may admit a limited number of applicants who show the potential for success in collegiate work but who do not meet all the regular admission standards.
The special admissions programs are as follows:
Adult Learner Program
All persons 25 years of age or older prior to the first day of class for any given semester, who hold a high school diploma or General Equivalency Diploma, may be considered for admission as an Adult Learner. Admission as an Adult Learner is an unclassified/non-degree seeking student status. If attendance at a college or university has been within two years of anticipated enrollment, students must submit transcripts indicating a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 on a 4.00 scale and be in good standing at the last school attended. Adult Learners who, at some later time, wish to become candidates for a degree must complete a minimum of 12 semester hours at Illinois State, apply for admission as a degree seeking student, and meet university admission requirements for the desired program. A student's Illinois State Adult Learner GPA is used in determining admission to desired major, along with other course prerequisites. 
Concurrent Admissions Program (ConAp) for Army and Army Reserve Enlistees
The Concurrent Admission Program (ConAp) is a partnership between the Army Recruiting Command and over 1,900 participating colleges to mutually advance the goals of lifelong learning and postsecondary education for Future Soldiers. This program allows individuals enlisting in the Army or Army Reserve who are part of the Future Soldier program to declare their intent to enroll at a college or university at the time of their enlistment. The Future Soldier submits a College Referral and Intent to Enroll form to a ConAp college stating his/her intent to enroll during or after their enlistment. The college acknowledges the intent to enroll form and sends information about the college to the Future Soldier. 
The ConAp form provides guidelines about applying for admission, preparing for the academic experience, beginning college work during enlistment, and staying in touch with the college. Please note that individuals must apply to Illinois State by using the standard application process, and individuals must meet admission requirements in effect at the time of their enrollment. In addition, a DD214 showing honorable discharge is required as part of the application process.
Dual Enrollment Program
Offers qualified high school students an opportunity to take college-level classes. Dual Enrollment students are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If admitted, they are given unclassified student status and are advised by University College. They cannot be full-time students while still in high school and must take classes offered on campus.
Talent Program
Applicants who demonstrate an outstanding talent in art, music, theatre, dance, forensics, or athletics.
Veterans Program
Applicants who were Illinois residents at the time of entrance into the Armed Forces, who present a discharge for other than dishonorable reasons showing completion of at least a one-year active tour of duty in the Armed Forces, and whose first attendance at a college or university after discharge is at Illinois State can be considered for admission through this program.
Inquiries regarding these programs should be directed to the Office of Admissions, 201 Hovey Hall, Illinois State University, Campus Box 2200, Normal, IL 61790-2200,  (800) 366-2478 or VetAdmissions@IllinoisState.edu and should specify the particular program of interest.
Criminal Activity and Disciplinary Disclosure
Illinois State University is committed to maintaining a safe and positive environment for all members of the University community. Therefore, at the time of application, applicants will be required to disclose information regarding criminal background. In addition, applicants must report misconduct that resulted in disciplinary separation from a previous school or university. These cases will be reviewed by the University prior to an admission decision being made. Such disclosure does not automatically disqualify an applicant. For additional information, please contact the Office of Admissions.
Fraudulent Documents [HA1]
All documents and information submitted to the University are required to be true, accurate, and complete and the submission of documents that are forged, fraudulent, altered from the original, materially incomplete, obtained under false pretenses, or otherwise deceptive is prohibited as is the submission of information that is inaccurate or misleading, whether by act or omission. Further, it is the applicant's responsibility to notify the Office of Admissions of any changes to submitted application documentation and information. 
Submission of fraudulent documents or information in the admission process shall automatically invalidate the application to Illinois State university and be grounds for revocation of admission and/or a temporary or permanent ban on future admission. 
Immunization and Medical Requirements for all Students
All Illinois State University students are required, by College Immunization Code (77 III.Adm.Code 694), to provide documentation of the following:
Two Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccines given on or after the first birthday for students born after January 1, 1957.
A combination of 3 shots for DTP/Dtap/Td/ or Tdap. One must be a Tdap. One must be within the last ten years.
One Meningococcal conjugate vaccine after the age of 16 for new students under the age of 22 as of the first day of class. (Meningitis B and Menomune do not meet this requirement).
All immunization dates must be signed/certified by a physician or public health official. All immunization records must be submitted in English.
Please note that a physical examination is not required. International students are required by University regulations to have TB screening within ten days of their arrival on campus. The Student Health Services also strongly recommends that all students have immunization against Hepatitis B (a series of three injections).
Information and further instructions for meeting the stated requirements will be provided via future communication from Student Health Services for all incoming students. Student Health Services recommends completion of the immunization information as soon as possible. Students not in compliance with the immunization requirements by the 10th class of the first semester will have subsequent semester registrations blocked and be assessed an administrative noncompliance fee. 
Further information can be obtained by calling Student Health Services at (309) 438-7559.

Master of Science in Chemistry Program
Master of Science in Chemistry Education Program
Master of Chemistry Education Program
Master of Science in Chemistry Program
Degree Offered: M.S.
The program is broad-based, and allows students to specialize in any of the sub-disciplines (physical, organic, inorganic, analytical, biochemistry, or chemical education), although coursework is required in at least four sub-disciplines. The Master of Science in Chemistry (M.S.) is a thesis-based M.S. degree requiring 31 credit hours including: Four hours each in CHE 490 (Research) and CHE 499 (Master's Thesis) are required as part of the 31-hour program, although most students will register for more than the total of eight required hours while pursuing the degree. Students select a research advisor and work closely with that faculty member to complete a thesis based upon original research. Upon completion of a written thesis, a final oral examination/thesis defense is required.
In general, students admitted to the Master of Science in Chemistry program should have completed coursework in science and math equivalent to that required for a B.S. degree in Chemistry at Illinois State University or have received an American Chemical Society-certified B.S. degree from another school. If a student will be admitted to the Master's degree program with deficiencies (though no student will be admitted with 12 or more credit hours of deficiencies in Chemistry coursework), the deficiencies will be identified as specific courses and students will have to complete those courses as early as possible in order to bring their background coursework to the required level. All deficiencies should be completed by the end of the third semester in the program. In general, credit earned for completion of deficiencies does not apply toward M.S. degree requirements unless the student petitions the Department and receives approval to count specific courses (up to a maximum of six credit hours) for graduate credit in the student's plan of study, and only courses listed as approved for graduate credit on Course Finder may be counted.
This 31-hour degree requires: 
21 hours of 400 and/or CHE 300-level courses including a minimum of 12 credit hours of courses at the 400 level in 3 sub-disciplines (analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, biochemistry, and chemical education)
2 hours: 1 hour each CHE 492 and CHE 494
8 hours: 4 hours each in CHE 490 and CHE 499
Successful completion of a thesis based upon original research and oral examination/thesis defense Graduate coursework in related disciplines may be substituted with consent of the Chemistry Department.

Students who have not satisfied the language requirement for an M.A. before entering the program must do so by the commencement of the third semester (or, for part-time students, with the acquisition of the equivalent number of semester hours) while pursuing the program.

Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) Program
Degree Offered: M.F.A.
The Master of Fine Arts in Art is a 60-hour program that emphasizes both theory and practice in the production, history, and teaching of the visual arts. Candidates will be expected to demonstrate artistic proficiency in at least one of the following disciplines: painting and drawing, sculpture and expanded media, printmaking, video, ceramics, photography, or glass. Candidates will also be expected to demonstrate proficiency in written and oral communication.
Students may also engage in an internship or apprenticeship. This may take the form of a guided teaching experience or work in a professional area related to the student's area of interest. The exact nature of this experience will be worked out through counseling between the major advisor and the student and will be tailored to best suit the needs of each student. This project will be subject to approval of the student's graduate committee and the School Director.
It should be understood that the accumulation of 60 semester credit hours is not the primary criterion in evaluating a student’s final achievement. The primary criterion in the evaluation of the MFA degree will be a Thesis Exhibition which demonstrates intellectual maturity and artistic proficiency in the student’s major studio area. In addition to the Thesis Exhibition, the MFA degree requires the completion of a Thesis Supportive Statement, which is a critical essay that focuses on the student’s studio work, its development, and its cultural and historical references. The M.F.A. Candidate will be required to pass an oral defense.
This 60-hour degree program requires:
36 semester hours must be taken in the Wonsook Kim School of Art, of these at least 24 must be at the 400 level
24 semester hours must be in the student's major studio area, of these at least 18 must be at the 400 level
Of the total required 60 hours, 12 semester hours must be taken in art history, or nine hours may be taken in art history with three hours in related areas such as aesthetics, philosophy, or anthropology, or ART 494 MFA Seminar
3 hours: ART 494 MFA Seminar. Taking the MFA Seminar to satisfy Art History requirements does not substitute for this requirement (494 is included within the 36 hours)
6 hours: ART 496 M.F.A. Exhibition and Supportive Statement. This will involve a comprehensive exhibition of studio work, an exhibition-related written project, and a comprehensive oral examination. A candidacy review must take place before a student can enroll in ART 496 or schedule the MFA exhibition and must include approval of proposal for the supportive statement. (496 is included within the 36 hours.)
The School reserves the right to keep images of original work produced by graduate students for educational and archival purposes.

Requirements
Transfer Student Admission Requirements
Illinois State University is a leading destination for transfer students in Illinois. With 30 percent of our students transferring from other colleges and universities, Illinois State is known for being a transfer-friendly institution.
Many programs have required and recommended courses and minimum GPA requirements, in addition to the University Requirements listed below.
Transferring Credit
Transfer Admission Guide
Majors
Due to space limitations and the competitiveness of the applicant pool, it may not be possible to offer admission to all qualified applicants. Highest admission priority will be granted to transfer students with the strongest academic records. Earning an associate's degree does not guarantee admission.
Transfer students with a minimum 2.4 GPA may be admitted to the University as undeclared if program prerequisites were not met or if space is not available in the preferred major. Students with 75 or more semester hours completed will not be admitted as undeclared.
University Requirements
What Admissions considers:
Official college transcript from each college or university attended (cumulative college GPA)
Prerequisite college coursework, for some academic programs
Good academic standing at the last college attended
Optional personal statement
Other considerations:
If you are a transfer student with fewer than 24 semester hours at the time you apply, you will also need:
High school transcript (cumulative GPA, grade trends, and rigor of courses completed)
Official SAT or ACT scores sent from the testing agency (optional)
GED scores (if non-high school graduate)
Test-takers must score a minimum of 150 on each part of the GED
If all four sections were completed prior to December 31, 2013:
Minimum score of 410 on each of the five tests
Average battery score of 450
Please note: Remedial coursework will not be taken into consideration when calculating the admission GPA or the number of semester hours earned at the time of application.
General Coursework Recommendations
We encourage all transfer students to complete the course equivalents of the following courses before they enroll at Illinois State:
Introductory-level composition (ENG 101)
Intermediate-level composition (ENG 145)
Introductory-level speech (COM 110)
An Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) approved math course (non-remedial, transferable math)
The Associate of Science degree from an Illinois public community college does not require the following courses: one humanities/fine art and one social and behavioral science. If you would like your Associate of Science degree to complete your general education requirements, we recommend completing these two courses at the community college before you transfer. However, these two courses can also be completed while attending Illinois State.
The Associate of Arts degree will fulfill general education requirements automatically.
Many programs have required and recommended courses and minimum GPA requirements, in addition to the University requirements. Please review the program requirements for your intended major before you apply.
Foreign Language Graduation Requirements
It is helpful for transfer students who wish to pursue a major in the College of Arts and Sciences or any Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree to complete foreign language graduation requirements prior to attending Illinois State.
The College of Arts and Sciences requirement may be met by:
Three years of one language in high school, OR
Completion of the second semester (LAN 112) or higher of a college-level foreign language (including American Sign Language) with a grade of C or better.
B.A. candidates must successfully complete three semesters (through LAN 115) OR pass a course proficiency test. These are required for graduation, not admission.
Admitted Transfer Student Profile
Middle 50% ranges for 2021
2.93-3.67 GPA
 Personal Statement
All applicants are welcome to submit a personal statement for review, though it is not required to complete your application. This statement may be considered along with other application materials to determine eligibility for admission. If you opt not to submit a statement and further review is needed to make an admission decision, we will request a personal statement from you at that time.
If you would like to submit a personal statement, your submission should be approximately 500 words in length and address the contributions you are prepared to make to our community, both academically and otherwise. Specifically, your statement should:
Identify any circumstances that affected your academic performance, if applicable
Make clear your commitment to academic success in college, acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses and your plans to utilize available resources
Articulate your readiness to engage productively in our campus community outside the classroom

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

This interdisciplinary minor prepares students to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in their communities. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world. The minor gives students opportunities to sharpen their analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action. The minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden their learning experience and career perspectives.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

 Minor in Ethnic Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies.

Languages, Literatures and Cultures
Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language.

Major in Integrated Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Master of Professional Accountancy (M.P.A.)
The integrated B.S./M.P.A. Degrees program is primarily oriented toward preparation for professional careers in accounting. Two sequences are offered: (1) Accountancy and Information Systems, and (2) Professional Accountancy. Both sequences permit graduates of the B.S. and M.P.A. degrees to meet minimum education requirements to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination in Illinois.
The 150-hour B.S. (min. 120 hours) and M.P.A. (min. 30 hours of graduate level coursework) integrated program is designed for students wishing to complete both degrees at Illinois State University. The B.S. degree is awarded after completion of the undergraduate degree requirements and the M.P.A. degree is awarded after completion of the graduate degree requirements. The program is not designed to admit students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree.
Students must successfully apply for continuance in the B.S./M.P.A. program in their junior year. Graduate admission would take place after the student has completed approximately 90 hours. Students will be admitted who meet graduate entrance requirements, which include satisfactory performance on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), their previous academic performance, and other evidence of their ability to successfully complete the program. Admission timing is very important to successfully complete the program so students should regularly consult with their Accounting undergraduate or graduate advisor.
Courses completed in the Department of Accounting at this University with grades below C will not count toward the graduation requirements of the Integrated BS/MPA Major, but all grades of D, F, and WX in Accounting courses at this University will be included in computing the cumulative GPA.
Students in the integrated B.S./M.P.A Degrees program must complete one of the following sequences.
Accountancy and Information Systems Sequence

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

Graduate
Specialist in School Psychology
Specialist in School Psychology
The Specialist in School Psychology degree is offered in the Department of Psychology in the College of Arts and Sciences. Approved 1991. The Specialist in School Psychology degree requires the completion of a minimum of 60 semester hours of graduate level course work including practicum experiences; a full- time, nine-month internship in a school setting, and completion of a thesis or non-thesis option. The thesis option requires a minimum of 4 semester hours of PSY 499 credit. The non-thesis option requires 4 semester hours of an applied research experience in School Psychology.
Students must maintain a grade point average of at least 3.0 throughout their graduate training. Additionally, no more than 9 semester hours with grades of “C” are permissible.
Students must present, exclusive of Thesis 499 or the applied research experience, not less than 30 hours of 400-level course work.
Credit Requirements
Approved 1991, rev 3/03, edited 6/05; 2/17/15
The S.S.P. degree requires the completion of a minimum of 60 semester hours of graduate level coursework including practicum experiences; a thesis or applied research experience in school psychology and a full-time internship in a school setting.
Deficiencies
Approved 1991
When an applicant has been accepted, the department will indicate any courses that may be required to remove undergraduate deficiencies. The department also may specify certain graduate courses which will be required in addition to those listed in the catalog and will designate which, if any, of these courses may be used in meeting requirements for the degree.
Time Limitations
All requirements for the S.S.P. degree must be completed within six calendar years, beginning with the date the student first registers as a Specialist in School Psychology degree student. See Master’s Degree Time Limitations section for complete policy. The form is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Transfer Credit
Approved 1991, updated 3/22/01
Upon recommendation of the department and with the approval of the Graduate School, a student may present a maximum of nine semester hours of graduate credit from another college or university that is accredited by the appropriate regional accrediting association for use in meeting the requirements of the
S.S.P. degree. See entire policy under Master’s Transfer Credit section. 
Admission to Candidacy
To be admitted to candidacy for the S.S.P. degree the student must have a minimum grade point average of
3.0 in graduate coursework at Illinois State, completed all deficiencies, successful completion of PSY 402 or a Thesis Proposal Approval form for PSY 499, on file in the Graduate School, if a thesis is the culminating experience for the specialist program, and an approved Degree Audit on file in the Graduate School. 
Registration for Thesis Work
Approved 1991
The student under the thesis option must register for four hours of 499 Thesis. Any student using the services of the academic staff or the facilities of the University must be registered for the semester or term during which the services are rendered or the facilities are used including the thesis proposal or defense. Also, to register for 499 the student must be working on the subject under the direction of the advisor or thesis chairperson. No grade will be given for the course but credit (CR) will be entered on the student's record at the time the approved thesis is deposited in the Graduate School Office. No credit for 499 may be given to a student who does not complete a thesis. 
Continuous Registration - SSP
Approved 11/14/96; edited 4/26/23
After the Thesis Proposal approval form has been accepted in the Graduate School and a student has completed the courses on the approved Degree Audit and registered for four hours of 499 Thesis, the student is required to maintain continuous registration. The requirement for continuous registration may be fulfilled by registering for Thesis 499.00. The requirement for continuous registration does not apply during a summer term unless the student is proposing, defending, or graduating in that term. Registration for 499.00 may be in absentia. If circumstances prohibit continuing registration a student must request a leave of absence from the University. Any student interrupting registration without obtaining a leave of absence must pay tuition for one credit hour of 499.00 for each of the delinquent semesters upon reenrollment and/or reinstatement. Any student requesting reinstatement in a degree program must complete an application for readmission to the program. Continuous registration is required until the submission of all final deposit materials to the Graduate School. Consult with the Graduate School for more information. (See also Academic Load for Graduate Assistant insurance information.) 
Thesis Committee
Approved 1991; Revised 4/22/04; edited 4/26/23
A thesis is written under the direction of a thesis committee appointed in a manner specified by the department. The committee normally consists of three or more full members of the Graduate Faculty, but shall not be fewer than two members. In all cases the chair must have full graduate faculty status. The majority of the committee, which includes the chair, should have full graduate faculty status. An associate Member may co-chair a thesis with a Full Member. Inquire with your department for any additional requirements. Proposed committee members who are not members of the Illinois State University Graduate Faculty must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies. A student must be admitted to a Specialist degree program in the Graduate School before a thesis committee can be appointed.
Thesis Proposal
Approved 1991
The Proposal for Research, including the title, scope, and design, must be approved by the student's thesis committee before a student is admitted to candidacy. The student is required to file an approved Proposal for Research with the department at a time and in a manner specified by the department. Institutional policy requires that all research involving human subjects be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Research involving animals must be approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Research involving biohazards must be reviewed by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC).

Academic Terminology
Academic Terminology
Academic Advisement Report: The Academic Advisement Report is an assessment of the undergraduate student’s academic progress toward completion of requirements for the bachelor’s degree. This report may be viewed on the Academic Requirements on My.IllinoisState.edu. To determine specific program requirements (in addition to the  general requirements for graduation stated above), students should  consult the following sections of the Undergraduate Catalog: (1) the  General Education requirements; (2) the specific requirements for the major and minor fields of study; and, if the student seeks teacher  licensure, (3) the University‐wide Teacher Education program  requirements in this Undergraduate Catalog.
Academic Affairs: One of the four major divisions of the University, headed by the Vice President and Provost, that focuses on educational needs of students.
Academic Good Standing: A minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00, which is required for continued enrollment in the University.
Academic Programs:
Major: A cohesive combination of courses, including introductory, intermediate, and advanced coursework that designates a student’s primary area of specialization. Majors are designated on university transcripts. In Campus Solutions (student information system) a major is referred to as a 'plan'. 
Minor: A combination of courses designed to provide a cohesive introduction to an area of study beyond the major. Minors are designated on university transcripts upon receipt of degree.
Sequence: A subdivision of a major/minor in which there are specific requirements. Sequences of the same major or minor generally share a common core within a major or minor. Sequences are designated on university transcripts upon receipt of degree. In Campus Solutions (student information system) a sequence is referred to as a 'sub-plan'. 
Certificate: 
Undergraduate certificates are a group of courses focusing on a specific area of knowledge or competency designed to provide professional development and career advancement opportunities, to broaden career options, or to enhance an individual's skills or education as part of the process of life-long learning. These certificates are not part of degree programs, although courses completed as part of a certificate curriculum could be used in meeting degree requirements, where appropriate. Undergraduate Certificates require a minimum of 9 credit hours and a maximum of 17 credit hours. Certificate programs should be designed for students who are not in a major/minor in which the certificate resides. However, there may be exceptions. Certificates should not duplicate major/minor requirements. 
Concentration: A subdivision of a major without specific requirements that is provided for advisement only. Concentrations are not designated on university transcripts. All informal curricular recommendations made by departments and schools (such as emphases, tracks, areas of study, specializations, etc.) should be considered concentrations. Concentrations are advisory only; no approval process is required.
Academic Year: The period of time commencing with the fall semester (16 weeks) and continuing through the spring semester (16 weeks) and summer term (12 weeks).
Advanced Placement Program:  Sponsored by the College Board, this program allows students to be awarded credit or exemptions from required courses based on test scores.
Alumni: Individuals who have attended or graduated from a particular college or university.
Audit: The completion of a course taken without credit. It does not count toward full-time student status for financial aid and other purposes.
Board of Trustees: The governing body for Illinois State University.
Campus Solutions: Student Information System software that supports registration and managing students’ progress toward their degrees.
Career: Campus Solutions term for undergraduate or graduate status.
Clinical Experience: Part of a program that allows for observation, participation, studies of individual pupils or clients, individual field work, and practicums both on and off campus.
College Level Examinations Program (CLEP):  A program that allows students to receive credit by examination rather than completing coursework.
Courses:
The University operates on semesters. The credit value of all courses is stated in terms of semester hours. University's Credit Hour Policy 
Students should consult the Course Finder website for course descriptions, prerequisites, and course offerings and My.IllinoisState.edu for class availability. The registration system will enforce prerequisites in effect at the time of registration. Questions regarding course offerings should be referred to the department chairperson or school director. 
Course numbering and terms used in course descriptions
Combination Courses: Course format that combines lecture and laboratory components in each class meeting.
Directed Research: Course format used for independent study, thesis, and dissertation courses.
Independent Study: Intensive study in a special area of the student’s interest under the direction of a qualified member of the faculty. Each individual investigation is to culminate in a comprehensive written report and/or examination and/or artistic project. A maximum of six semester hours of independent study may be applied toward graduation.
Professional Practice: Professional Practice consists of one or more credit-generating, academic/career related, salaried or non-salaried work experiences. Professional Practice work sites are located on the Illinois State University campus and with business, industry, government, and other agencies and organizations outside the University. Professional Practice courses are designated by the numbers 198, 298, 398, 498, and 598. A student may count no more than 16 hours of professional practice courses (198, 298, 398) toward graduation.
Seminar: A regular meeting of students, under the guidance of a faculty member, in which each conducts research and exchanges information, problems, and results through informal lectures, reports, and discussions.
Temporary Course: Temporary courses are active for one year and may not be required for a major, sequence, minor or a certificate. Temporary courses are often used to take advantage of the skills of a faculty member who will be at the University for a limited period, or to respond to particular interests of students. Temporary courses are designated by the numbers 189, 289, 389, 489, and 589. 
Course Modality: Refer to the Office of the Registrar's website for definitions. 
Credit Hour: A standard unit of measuring coursework; credit hours are assigned to a particular course and count toward graduation, except in remedial courses. Typically a course that meets for three hours a week is worth three credit hours.
Cross-listed Course: Cross-listed courses are offered by more than one department or school, but treated as one course for credit purposes. A cross-listed course will be considered as one course regardless of the department/school through which the student registered for the course. This is a general rule that applies to all cross-listed courses taken for any purpose.
Curriculum: A program of study covering the entire undergraduate or graduate career and designed to satisfy the requirements for a degree.
Dean: The highest administrative officer of a college.
Dean of Students: 
Through a variety of services, solutions, and support, the Dean of Students Office helps students apply what they learn in the classroom to real-life practice. The Dean of Students Office also serves as a student support network by providing advocacy, problem resolution, and crisis intervention for those times when additional support is needed.

For example, diploma school or Associate Degree nursing courses are “held in escrow” for the student until successful completion of three specified Nursing upper-division courses at Illinois State University.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

The Minor in African-American Studies provides an interdisciplinary approach to the examination of black politics and life in the United States. This program is designed to be of interest to students who want to explore the many contributions African-Americans have made to the political, historical, social, and artistic fabric of the United States. Students are required to take a core of two courses on African-American history and literature, as well as elective courses in the social sciences (History, Sociology, and Politics and Government) and in the humanities and fine arts (English, Music, and Theatre and Dance), and in interdisciplinary programs (including relevant course offerings in Interdisciplinary Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies).

Interested students should contact the Office of International Studies and Programs.
 Minor in Children's Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The Minor in Children's Studies provides an opportunity for students to enhance their knowledge of children and child culture through interdisciplinary exploration of child-related issues. This program is designed to be of interest to students who wish to pursue child-related emphases in their major disciplines, such as education, children's literature, child psychology, children's history and culture, pediatrics, juvenile justice, or social work with children, or for those who wish to learn more about the subject of childhood from multidisciplinary frames of reference.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

The Minor in Peace and Conflict Resolution Studies is an interdisciplinary program that includes courses from eighteen departments. The Minor provides a comprehensive and in-depth approach to peace and conflict resolution theories and methods. Students are required to take an introductory course, as well as one course from each of four areas of inquiry (social justice, violence prevention and conflict resolution, environmental justice, and globalization), while also specializing in one of these areas with two additional courses. The minor's capstone experience is a professional practice.
The Minor allows students to examine the causes and prevention of war, as well as the nature of violence, including social oppression, discrimination and marginalization. They also learn peace strategies to overcome persecution and transform society to attain a more just and equitable international community. The inquiry encompasses micro to macro perspectives. At the micro end of the spectrum, students investigate non-violent ethics and conflict management; interpersonal communication and relations; intergroup relations; and diversity and gender issues. At the macro level, students explore the dynamics of international conflict, as well as approaches to peace and world order; ethnic and socioeconomic justice; multiculturism; renewable economics; and biodiversity.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Admission to the English major may be affected and restricted by the lack of available Department resources in times of oversubscription. Students in the major and all sequences must pass ENG 100 with a C or better in order to advance and complete the program. 
For information about admission to this program visit the 
University’s Academics website
.
The Accelerated English Education Sequence (AEES) is an Accelerated Master's Degree (AMD) program, which serves as a pathway to the Master's in English Education. This AMD is designed for undergraduate teacher education students who, when they graduate with their undergraduate degree, will pursue employment as secondary English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. Qualifying students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher may apply to the AEES once they have reached junior status. Admission is based on competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures are available on the English Education website and applications are considered on a rotating basis each fall and spring semester. Acceptance into the AEES constitutes acceptance into the MA/MS in English Education. To transfer to graduate-only status after completing the BA in English Education, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the MA/MS in English Education. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing.

Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of English participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the following minors: African Studies, African-American Studies, Children’s Studies, Civic Engagement and Responsibility, Cognitive Science, Ethnic Studies, European Studies, International Studies, Latin American and Latino/a Studies, Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies, Native American Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and also the Minor in Religious Studies in the Department of Philosophy. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs and Department of Philosophy sections.
Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing. By providing a broad work experience, students not only build their portfolios, but also enter the marketplace with valuable and current skills.
View Publishing Studies Sequence Course Requirements
Technical Writing and Rhetorics Sequence

Focusing on this sequence prepares you for a career as a technical and professional writer in a variety of settings, such as corporate, nonprofit, and governmental organizations. You will develop the skills and knowledges needed to communicate specialized information effectively to a range of audiences. The sequence offers degrees in both the B.A. and the B.S.
View Technical Writing and Rhetorics Sequence Course Requirements

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

This interdisciplinary minor prepares students to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in their communities. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world. The minor gives students opportunities to sharpen their analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action. The minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden their learning experience and career perspectives.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

 Minor in Ethnic Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies. 
18 credit hours required
Take 6 courses as indicated below from the following groups (at least 4 courses must be above the 100 level). With consent of the faculty advisor, students may use departmental or IDS 287, 298, or 398 courses for one course in Group II and/or one course in Group III.

The department strongly recommends students take at least 6 credit hours of advanced electives in the major. 
A chemistry or math course in the major may not be attempted more than twice during a student’s undergraduate career. An exception may be requested only once for only one course during a student's undergraduate career if the GPA in the major plan is 2.00 or higher, and the overall GPA is 2.00 or higher. A student who does not complete the course with a grade of C or better on the third attempt will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Any student who would need an additional third enrollment to enroll in any other required chemistry or math course in the major will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Each attempt in which the student receives a grade, including a grade of WX, is counted as an attempt.

Graduate Certificates
Graduate Certificates
Approved 11/29/01; Revised 2018
Graduate-level certificates are graduate courses of study approved by an academic unit designed to provide professional development and career advancement opportunities, to broaden career options, or to enhance an individual’s skills or education as part of the process of life-long learning. These certificates are not part of degree programs, although courses completed as part of a certificate curriculum could be used in meeting degree requirements, where appropriate.
A non-degree graduate certificate student is one who has been formally admitted by a department or school to a specific course of study leading to a certificate. There are two types of non-degree graduate certificates. 
Post-Baccalaureate Graduate Certificate: Requires a minimum of nine semester hours of graduate courses beyond the baccalaureate degree, but fewer hours than a master’s degree.
Post-Master’s Graduate Certificate: Requires a minimum of 9 semester hours of graduate courses beyond the master’s degree, but fewer hours than a doctoral degree.
Admission
An applicant for a course of study leading to a Graduate or Post-Baccalaureate Certificate must have a bachelor’s degree from a four-year college or university that is accredited by the appropriate regional accrediting association, or its equivalent as determined by the Graduate School. For a Post- Master’s Certificate, the applicant must have a master’s degree from a college or university that is accredited by the appropriate regional accrediting association, or its equivalent as determined by the Graduate School. Applicants must also meet the specific requirements stipulated by the academic unit offering the certificate.
Academic Advisor
A Graduate, Post-Baccalaureate, or Post-Master’s certificate course of study shall have a designated coordinator or director assigned by the academic unit chair that is sponsoring the certificate to advise students and confirm completion of the certificate requirements.
For a complete listing of each certificate program’s graduate coordinator(s) or director(s) please visit Grad.IllinoisState.edu/Faculty/Coordinators. 
GPA Minimum
In order to be awarded the certificate, a student must have a minimum graduate GPA of 3.0 in the set of courses required for the certificate.
Time Limitations
All requirements for a graduate level certificate must be completed within six calendar years, beginning with the date the student first registers as a graduate level certificate student. This limitation applies to enrollment in all graduate coursework for the certificate including work for which transfer credit is allowed. Refer to the time limitation regulation for master’s degrees for additional criteria which would apply.
Transfer of Credit
No more than 40 percent of coursework hours required can be transferred from other accredited institutions to satisfy the certificate requirements.
Additional Requirements and Information
Students must complete the same prerequisites or have the equivalent experiences as graduate degree candidates to enroll in specific courses.
No differentiation in course requirements will exist between graduate certificate courses and graduate degree courses.
Students seeking a graduate level certificate are subject to the academic policies and regulations indicated in this catalog. There will not be university recognition of graduate level certificate completion as part of the degree commencement activities except by agreement of the College whose academic unit sponsors the certificate.
The granting of a graduate level certificate will appear on the University transcript.
Eligibility for Financial Aid, Assistantships, or Fellowships
Certificate students are not eligible for graduate assistantships or fellowships intended for degree- seeking students nor federal financial aid. Graduate tuition waivers are granted at the discretion of the awarding unit.
Use of Courses in Degree Programs
Courses taken as part of a graduate certificate can be counted towards a master’s degree following degree grading criteria if the courses are appropriate for the specific degree program and are taken within an approved time frame.
Admission to a Degree Program: Individuals in a graduate-level certificate program who wish to apply to a degree program will go through the usual admissions process for a master’s degree, using the usual documentation (transcripts, standardized scores, etc.).

Master of Science in Chemistry Program
Master of Science in Chemistry Education Program
Master of Chemistry Education Program
Master of Science in Chemistry Program
Degree Offered: M.S.
The program is broad-based, and allows students to specialize in any of the sub-disciplines (physical, organic, inorganic, analytical, biochemistry, or chemical education), although coursework is required in at least four sub-disciplines. The Master of Science in Chemistry (M.S.) is a thesis-based M.S. degree requiring 31 credit hours including: Four hours each in CHE 490 (Research) and CHE 499 (Master's Thesis) are required as part of the 31-hour program, although most students will register for more than the total of eight required hours while pursuing the degree. Students select a research advisor and work closely with that faculty member to complete a thesis based upon original research. Upon completion of a written thesis, a final oral examination/thesis defense is required.
In general, students admitted to the Master of Science in Chemistry program should have completed coursework in science and math equivalent to that required for a B.S. degree in Chemistry at Illinois State University or have received an American Chemical Society-certified B.S. degree from another school. If a student will be admitted to the Master's degree program with deficiencies (though no student will be admitted with 12 or more credit hours of deficiencies in Chemistry coursework), the deficiencies will be identified as specific courses and students will have to complete those courses as early as possible in order to bring their background coursework to the required level. All deficiencies should be completed by the end of the third semester in the program. In general, credit earned for completion of deficiencies does not apply toward M.S. degree requirements unless the student petitions the Department and receives approval to count specific courses (up to a maximum of six credit hours) for graduate credit in the student's plan of study, and only courses listed as approved for graduate credit on Course Finder may be counted.
This 31-hour degree requires: 
21 hours of 400 and/or CHE 300-level courses including a minimum of 12 credit hours of courses at the 400 level in 3 sub-disciplines (analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, biochemistry, and chemical education)
2 hours: 1 hour each CHE 492 and CHE 494
8 hours: 4 hours each in CHE 490 and CHE 499
Successful completion of a thesis based upon original research and oral examination/thesis defense Graduate coursework in related disciplines may be substituted with consent of the Chemistry Department.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives

Graduation Requirements
These are general requirements for all students. Students may apply for and receive two bachelor's degrees at the same time. Refer to the Academic Policies and Practices section of the catalog for details.
120 minimum total credit hours
A minimum of 40 of the 120 total hours must be senior college hours (200-300 level courses)
AMALI requirement (certain courses in General Education and/or major may fulfill the AMALI requirement)
IDEAS (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Access in U.S. Society) requirement (certain courses in General Education and/or major may fulfill the IDEAS requirement)
Students completing a Bachelor of Science degree must complete a B.S. - Science, Math, & Technology degree requirement (beyond the General Education requirements) 
Students completing a Bachelor of Arts degree must complete a B.A. - world language degree requirement: LAN/FRE/GER/SPA/ITA/JPN/POR 115 (or equivalent) 
Some majors complete other types of degrees that do not include additional graduation requirements. For example, the Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S. in Ed.) or the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.). 
Specific Program Requirements
Second bachelor degree seeking students are required to fulfill degree requirements as listed in the catalog at the time of admission to the second bachelor degree program. The program of studies completed for the second degree must include at least 32 semester hours of coursework taken after the granting of the first degree, of which 30 hours must be taken in residence at Illinois State. At least 24 of the 32 hours completed toward the second degree must be at senior college-level (courses numbered 200 and above).
General Education Requirements
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
The first way is to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program (see below for details).
The second way is to complete the Illinois Transferable General Education Core Curriculum available through the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) (see below for details).
The third way is to complete a baccalaureate-oriented Associates Degree (A.A. or A.S.) from a regionally accredited post-secondary institution. For those transferring from an Illinois college or university, the A.S. degree must include the complete IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) or the student must complete the GECC to fulfill Illinois State’s General Education requirement.
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours). Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses. Depending on their major, students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major.

To be eligible for IAI, at least one transfer course must have been articulated to an IAI core requirement. Refer to the Undergraduate Catalog for a complete list of IAI courses and policies.

Master of Arts Degree Requirements
Approved 12/3/98, edited 3/29/05, 3/22/16
The Master of Arts degree is awarded to a student who has completed an appropriate degree program and met the foreign language requirement for this degree at the college level. This requirement may be met by:
Completing a minimum of four semesters (or its equivalent, ISU's LAN 116) in one foreign language. The requirement may be met by earning a grade of C or better (or Credit or Pass) in the courses at either the graduate or undergraduate level.
Obtaining a satisfactory score on a university administered language examination approved by the Graduate School available in French, German, or Spanish at the University College Office. View additional MAPE information.
Students whose native language is not English may, with departmental or school approval, petition the Graduate School to substitute proficiency in the English language as fulfillment of the language requirement. Proficiency is met by achieving the university or program minimum, whichever is higher, total score on TOEFL or IELTS, or Duolingo exams. Academic English Program/Pathway students who have completed Illinois State Academic English Level 5 will also qualify.
Students wishing to use American Sign Language as the language requirement may do so if they have completed 4 semesters of ASL for credit at an accredited college or university (no adult education courses). Proficiency may also be tested but requires the use of an outside consultant. A fee will be assessed if a proficiency test is needed.
Other methods as determined by the department or school with approval by the Graduate School.
Degree Options and Credit Requirements
Edited 2/17/15
The following are the degree options, however, not all programs offer both options:
Master’s Degree with Thesis: No more than 6 and no less than 4 semester hours for thesis research and writing may be counted toward satisfying the 30 semester hour minimum of graduate work for a master’s degree with thesis. Fifty percent of all non-thesis hours must be at the 400 level and above.
Master’s Degree without Thesis: Consists of at least 30 semester hours of graduate work and includes a Comprehensive Examination and/or a culminating requirement demonstrating a mature application of skills and knowledge (e.g., professional practice, project, colloquia, and recital).
Master's Degree with Courses: Consists of at least 30 hours of graduate work demonstrating skills or knowledge of content competency.
Fifty percent of the courses completed, must be at the 400 level or higher.
Time Limitations
Approved 11/6/86, Updated 3/22/01
All requirements for the degree must be completed within six calendar years, beginning with the date the student first registers as a degree student. This time limit applies to enrollment in all graduate course work in the student’s program including work for which transfer credit is allowed, as well as courses taken as a visiting student if the student wants to use the courses toward a degree. A Request to Extend Time to Complete Degree Program must be completed by the student, graduate coordinator, and, if applicable, thesis chair, and submitted to the Graduate School for approval or denial. To access this form visit Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
If a course taken to complete the requirements for the degree is not within the six-year period allowed for the degree program, the student’s department or school may require the student to retake the course for credit or allow the student to demonstrate current knowledge and/or proficiency of the subject matter. If the latter is used, currency must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the department or school offering the course through successful completion of an appropriate examination or other assessment if available from the department or school. Otherwise, outdated coursework must be deleted from, and other course work must be substituted in, the degree audit.
Credits more than six years old at the time of first registration into a degree program are not transferable from other institutions. Individual departments and schools may have more stringent timelines. When graduate study is interrupted by military service or other contingencies, the six year limit may be extended with the approval of both the department or school and the Graduate School.
Transfer Credit
Approved 10/19/95; updated 2/24/00, 3/22/01; edited 6/27/04; updated 4/28/21; updated 10/25/23; updated 11/29/23
Upon recommendation of the department or school where the student is enrolled and with the approval of the Graduate School, a student may present a maximum of twelve semester hours or 33% of graduate credit coursework, whichever is higher, from another college or university that is accredited by the appropriate regional accrediting association for use in meeting the requirements of the degree. The work may be part of another graduate degree program. Under special circumstances, the Graduate School may allow a student to present a larger number of credits if recommended by the department or school. A student who plans to take work elsewhere should obtain prior approval indicating that the course or courses are appropriate to the student's curriculum at Illinois State University. Correspondence courses and independent studies are not accepted toward a degree.
To be considered for transfer of credit, a course must be taught at the graduate level and the student must have received at least a B grade in the course. In addition, a departmental or school evaluation of all courses presented is necessary prior to consideration by the Graduate School. The Request for Transfer of Credit form is at: Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
Residency Requirements
Approved 11/19/87
Except in the Wonsook Kim School of Art and Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, a candidate for a master's degree is not required to complete a residency requirement. For specific requirements of the department or school refer to the department or school program description.
Admission to Candidacy
Approved 11/19/87; edited 2/17/15
To be admitted to candidacy for the master's degree the student must have: a) a Degree Audit on file in the Graduate Office, b) completed all deficiencies, c) a minimum G.P.A. of 3.0 in graduate course work at Illinois State, and d) a copy of the thesis proposal approval form on file in the Graduate School if choosing a thesis option.
Master’s Comprehensive Examination
Approved 4/14/88; edited 2/17/15; edited 9/19/17; edited 4/24/18
For the comprehensive examination option, a comprehensive examination must be taken by each student before receiving the master’s degree. The content, process, scheduling, administration, and evaluation of the examination (oral, written, performance, or otherwise) are to be determined by each department and school. To apply for comprehensive examinations a student must:
be in good standing in a program,
have a Degree Audit on file in the department or school,
not be on academic probation, and
have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 at the time of the examination.
The following procedures apply to the comprehensive exam:
A student who fails the examination must wait until the next academic term before repeating the entire examination unless there are reasons that make an exception advisable. Exceptions must be requested from the Graduate School in writing by the student and advisor/chair/director.
Students who have twice failed the examination are not to repeat the exam unless they have completed further study as prescribed by the department chair or school director.
Comprehensive examinations may not be administered more than three times to individual students.
Department chairs and school directors are to notify students, by letter, of examination results within thirty days from the examination date.
A copy of this letter is to be sent to the Graduate School. (If it is a student’s second failure, recommendations for further study and appropriate warning of the situation are to be included in the letter.)
The Graduate School must receive the results from the department or school no fewer than 10 working days before the date of graduation.
After the first and second failure of comprehensive examination, the student can petition the department/school to repeat the comprehensive examination.
At the point of the third failure of comprehensive examination, the department/school will recommend to the Graduate School that the student be dismissed from the degree program.
Master’s Thesis Option
Approved 12/11/86
The student electing the thesis option must register for a minimum of four and a maximum of six hours of 499, Master's Thesis. Any student using the services of the academic faculty, staff, or the facilities of the University must be registered for the semester or term during which the services are rendered or the facilities are used including the thesis proposal or defense. Also, to register for 499 the student must be working on the subject under the direction of the advisor or thesis chairperson. No grade will be given for the course but credit (CR) will be entered on the student’s record after the final thesis is uploaded to ProQuest and finalized by the Graduate School. No credit for 499 may be given to a student who does not complete a thesis.
Master’s Thesis Committee
Approved 12/11/86; Revised 4/22/04; edited 4/26/23
A thesis is written under the direction of a thesis committee appointed in a manner specified by the department or school. All thesis committees require a minimum of two people, a chair from the student’s department/school and at least one other committee member. In all cases the chair must have full graduate faculty status. The majority of the committee, which includes the chair, should have full graduate faculty status. Inquire with your department/school for any additional requirements. An associate member may co-chair a thesis with a full member. Proposed committee members who are not members of the Illinois State University Graduate Faculty must be approved by the Director of Graduate Studies. See the “Graduate Committee Information” section on the “Proposal Approval Form” to indicate the faculty who need approval to serve on the committee. A student must be admitted to a degree program in the Graduate School before a thesis committee can be appointed.
Thesis Proposal
Approved 2/18/99, updated 2/18/99
The Thesis Proposal, including the title, scope, and design, must be approved by the student's thesis committee at the proposal hearing. The Thesis Proposal Approval Form should be completed after the successful proposal hearing and submitted and approved by the Graduate School before a student is admitted to candidacy to embark on thesis research. Institutional policy also requires that all research proposals involving human subjects be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Research proposals involving animals must be reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Research proposals involving biohazards must be reviewed by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC).
In special situations, and only with the approval of the thesis committee, the department chair or school director or designee, and the Graduate School, students may collaborate on some aspects of the work contributing to their theses. However, each thesis submitted to the Graduate School for approval must be a unique product with the degree candidate as the sole author and with due acknowledgment of the contribution of collaborators. The individual student must demonstrate to her or his committee satisfactory command of all aspects of the work presented.
Thesis Acceptance
Approved 3/23/95, edited 2/5/08; 2/17/15
A complete draft of the thesis must be uploaded to ProQuest before the “Right to Defend” will be issued to the student. View complete details on the completion of the thesis.
Continuous Thesis Registration
Approved 11/14/96; edited 1/2017; edited 4/26/23
After the Thesis Proposal approval form has been accepted in the Graduate School and a student has completed the courses on the approved degree audit and registered for four to six hours of 499 Master's Thesis, the student is required to maintain continuous registration until the submission of all final deposit materials to the Graduate School. The requirement for continuous registration may be fulfilled by maintaining registration of 1 hour of 499 each semester through the semester of degree completion. Students registering for less than 9 credit hours in fall or spring, or less than 6 credit hours in summer, will not have the insurance fee automatically assessed. See the Health Insurance website 
for further information. The requirement for continuous registration does not apply during a summer term unless the student is proposing, defending, or graduating in that term. Registration for 499 may be in absentia. If circumstances prohibit continuous registration, a student must request a leave of absence. Any student interrupting registration without obtaining a leave of absence, upon re-enrollment and/or reinstatement, must pay tuition and fees for one credit hour of 499, at the current tuition and fee rates, for each of the delinquent semesters. Any student requesting reinstatement in a degree program after a lapse of one calendar year must complete an application for readmission to the program. Continuous registration for an upcoming term may be waived if all materials are submitted to the Graduate School by the Friday before the next semester starts. Consult with the Graduate School for more information.
Full-Time Equivalency
Approved 1/27/21
If a student has completed the maximum requirement of thesis hours for the program, but more time is needed, a student may register for a 1 credit of thesis for up to two (2) semesters.  This 1 credit course will be counted at a level equivalent to full-time study for the purposes of loan deferment, continued use of university student services, and graduate assistant full-time enrollment eligibility requirements.  An approved PERS 938 (Reduced Course Load Request) is still required for graduate assistants enrolled in this option.
If more time is needed beyond the first two (2) semesters, a formal request for an extension can be made to the graduate school by the thesis advisor. Extensions may be approved for a maximum of two (2) additional semesters only if a clear plan for completion has been submitted and only if the student is working at a full-time equivalency on thesis work.  Graduate students who are using this extension cannot hold a graduate assistantship.  If the extension is approved, the full-time equivalency could be used for loan deferment or continued use of student services ONLY. 
An extension request must address the following:
An explanation of why the extension is necessary;
If the extension is being requested for one or two semesters;
Explanation of how the student is working at a full-time equivalency on thesis work;
A timeline for completion in the requested time-frame; and
Approval of the thesis advisor, the graduate coordinator, and the Graduate School.
Use of the 1 credit thesis option (or extended period) may also affect the cost of attendance if a student is applying for federal and state financial aid.  Students should consult the Financial Aid department to determine how use of the option will impact the student’s eligibility for federal and state financial aid.

Two Simultaneous Master's Degrees
Approved 11/6/86, revised 9/19/17
A maximum of 12 hours of course work is allowable to count simultaneously toward two (2) master's degrees provided certain other stipulations are met. These stipulations are as follows:
that the student must be enrolled in the second master's program at least one semester prior to the completion of the first degree,
that all requirements for both degree programs be met within the six year time limit,
that a particular thesis may not be used to meet the degree requirements for more than one degree, and
that not more than three hours of the 12 hours allowed to count toward the second degree be generated by independent study, practicum, or workshop credit.
Two Simultaneous Sequences
Approved 3/22/01
Two sequences offered within the same degree program may be recognized on a student’s transcript if the student is enrolled in both sequences simultaneously as part of the requirements for completing the degree program. A common core of degree requirements and common sequence requirements may be shared across both sequences subject to the following limitations:
Students must complete the requirements for both sequences before completing the degree requirements.
The requirements for the two sequences and the degree program must be completed within a six year time limit from the time of admission to the degree program.
No more than nine hours of independent study (400), workshop (493), or professional practice (498) can be shared for both sequences and the degree program.
Thesis hours may be shared by both sequences.
Students who have been awarded a graduate degree are not eligible to pursue a second sequence within the same degree program under these provisions.

Notes
Enrollment in 200-level business courses requires 45 completed credit hours. Enrollment in 300-level business courses requires 75 completed credit hours.
Courses for the language requirement and area studies requirement are often able to also meet general education requirements. Thus, careful consultation early in the IB program can reduce the number of hours needed to complete it.
IB majors are required to have an international experience consisting of a least one month abroad for a study abroad or an international internship. If this is a concern, there is an exemption process through the Director of the Carson and Iris Varner International Business Institute.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language. 
For information about admission to this program visit the University’s Academics website.

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.
