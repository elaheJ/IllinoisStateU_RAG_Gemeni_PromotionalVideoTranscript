# IllinoisStateU_RAG_Gemeni_PromotionalVideoTranscript
I use Google Gemeni long context on Illinois State University scraped data to create the transcript of a promotional video.
I crawled data from the ISU websited, when fed the whole data, Gemini reported above 5 M tokens, so I tried 1/6 chunks. The data is available in the repo.

Be sure to set mykey to your own gemeni key obtained here:
