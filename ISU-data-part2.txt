Admission/Retention Requirements
All incoming undergraduate students are initially enrolled in the B.A. or B.S. programs, depending on their interests. Those who wish to apply to the B.F.A. program do so no earlier than the first semester during their sophomore year. 
The School of Art expects regular class attendance and supports faculty members who choose to reduce course grades for lack of participation, including excessive absences.
Students seeking admission to the Major in Art must comply with criteria established by the School of Art, including submission of a portfolio of work for review by the School. Students interested in the Art History Sequence will submit a statement explaining their interest in the field, in lieu of the portfolio. Specific requirements for the portfolio and statement may be obtained from the School office.
To graduate with a Major in Art (B.A., B.S.) students must complete all requirements of one of the School of Art’s Sequences: Studio Arts, Graphic Design, Art History, or Teacher Education. They must also earn grades of C or better and maintain a 2.50 GPA in all courses taken in the School of Art, in addition to maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00. Individual sequences may have higher requirements. Courses in the Major may be repeated no more than once for the purpose of attaining the necessary minimum grade. Students may not enroll for the next course in a related series until the minimum grade in the prerequisite course is achieved. Incoming transfer students must retake courses considered equivalents to courses in the Major for which they earned lower than a grade of C. Students who do not meet these criteria will be placed on probation with the School of Art; a student placed on probation more than once will be dropped from the School.
Admission to some Sequences in Art may be restricted by the lack of available School resources, especially in times of oversubscription. 
In times of oversubscription and limitations on resources within the School of Art, some Discipline Areas may require faculty screening of students’ supportive materials before allowing individual students to enroll in the second course in that Discipline.
All Sequences in the Major in Art require successful completion of the Art History Core, the Foundations program appropriate to that sequence, a series of courses specific to the chosen sequence, and electives in Art. Students must complete all Sequence Foundations courses before being permitted to continue in one of the sequences in the Art major; gifted students may be allowed to take 200-level courses in their areas of interest during the freshman year, pending approval of the School. Students must also complete all Art History Core courses before they may enroll in 300-level Art History courses.
Students must make every effort to complete the required Foundations courses in their first three semesters in the program. Under most circumstances students will formally declare intention to enter a particular sequence in the Art major by the second semester of the sophomore year. Students will arrange to participate in screening requirements for their preferred sequence; those not accepted into competitive sequences may be reconsidered the following semester and should consult with appropriate faculty for advice before rescreening. Also in the sophomore year, students will begin enrolling in courses appropriate to their sequence of interest. In the case of the Studio Arts Sequence, this also requires declaring a specific Discipline Area in consultation with the School’s academic advisor.
Students can begin to take Graphic Design courses after they have completed the Art History core and Studio Art Foundation courses. There is no portfolio review for admission but students must have and maintain a major and cumulative 2.50 GPA. Students whose cumulative or major GPA falls below 2.50 will not be allowed to register for Graphic Design courses until the GPA has been raised to a 2.50 or higher. Consult the School of Art for further information on admission and retention in the Graphic Design sequence.
Students will be admitted to the Art History Sequence with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 and grades of B or better in ART 155 and ART 156. See the School of Art office for more information. Students will be allowed to continue in the sequence if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 2.50.
All Art majors planning to become licensed teachers must apply for and be admitted to the University Teacher Education program. Grades of C or better in all Art and Education courses, and a 2.50 cumulative and major GPA are required by the Art Teacher Education Area for admission and retention in the Art Teacher Education sequence. Continuation in the Art Teacher Education Sequence is not automatic. Students’ performance will be evaluated each semester.
The sequence in Teacher Education may also be combined with a sequence in Studio Arts, Graphic Design, or Art History. Pursuing a double sequence may require additional semesters. However, this option is strongly recommended to prepare students for teaching art. Students are also encouraged to take coursework in Urban Education and Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. 
Students may apply to the B.F.A. Degree program beginning in their sophomore year. Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the School of Art for the competitive review that is part of the admission process. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor. Students will be allowed to remain in the program if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 3.00.To graduate with a B.F.A., all Studio Arts sequence students are also required to organize and present a solo exhibition of their work during the final year. This exhibition must be accompanied by a public oral presentation, an exit portfolio and a written supportive statement approved by the student's B.F.A. faculty mentors.
Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program with a Sequence in Graphic Design must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the Graphic Design faculty for a competitive review. If a student drops below a 3.00 GPA or fails a required design course, the student will no longer be able to continue in the BFA sequence, but will be able to shift their design studies to the B.A./B.S. degree offering. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor.To graduate with a B.F.A., all Graphic Design sequence students are also required to participate in and help organize a group exhibition with the other B.F.A. Graphic Design students.

Major in Art (B.A., B.S.)
Students in the Art major must complete one of the following sequences.
Studio Arts Sequence
The Studio Arts Sequence emphasizes both breadth and depth of competence in Studio-based Art disciplines. It expands students’ horizons beyond the Foundations level with work in a variety of media and disciplines. By requiring intensive study, it develops depth within at least one Studio Discipline Area (ceramics, drawing, glass, intaglio, lithography, metal­work and jewelry design, painting, photography, sculpture, video, wood/metal or expanded media) through the completion of a specific series of courses. It likewise encourages exploration of new genres that break through traditional boundaries between disciplines and media. This sequence prepares students to work as visual arts professionals or pursue graduate studies.

Graphic Design Sequence
Students in the Graphic Design sequence develop an understanding of topics such as design research, branding and identity, information design, typography, book arts, interactive design, image making, time-based narratives, multicultural design, and civic engagement. In addition, students may gain professional experience in a graphic design internship. Internships will require a competitive portfolio review.
View Graphic Design Sequence Course Requirements
Art History Sequence
The Art History Sequence provides students a solid grounding in the history of art on both introductory and advanced levels. In addition, the sequence includes exposure to related disciplines outside the visual arts, training in foreign language, and experience in advanced research and writing skills. Together, these requirements prepare students for effective graduate work in Art History or other fields and for positions in a variety of art- and non-art-related fields. 
In special circumstances, students may satisfy the Art History language requirement with a language or languages other than “French, German, Italian or Spanish.” In such cases, the language(s) must be appropriate to the student’s plan of study and career goals. Alternate plans of language study must be approved by the Art History faculty in order to receive credit toward the sequence.
It is recommended that students select electives in courses related to Art History offered by the following departments/schools: Anthropology; English; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; History; Music; Philosophy; Theatre and Dance. Students are encouraged to consult with the Art History faculty for advice on choosing electives in Art History and other departments that will complement their own areas of interests. Faculty are also available for consultation on preparing for graduate school.
Students may combine Art History and Studio by declaring a second Sequence in Studio Arts and fulfilling all requirements for both sequences. This will include submitting a portfolio of art work for admission.

Illinois State University's General Education Program
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours).

Catalog
Undergraduate
Languages, Literatures and Cultures
Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

This interdisciplinary minor prepares students to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in their communities. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world. The minor gives students opportunities to sharpen their analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action. The minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden their learning experience and career perspectives.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

 Minor in Ethnic Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies. 
18 credit hours required
Take 6 courses as indicated below from the following groups (at least 4 courses must be above the 100 level). With consent of the faculty advisor, students may use departmental or IDS 287, 298, or 398 courses for one course in Group II and/or one course in Group III.

Minor in Global Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The minor in Global Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to enrich development of students as global citizens, and to prepare them for navigating an increasingly dynamic, complex and interconnected world. The minor helps students develop a global vision by promoting awareness of significant political, economic, and social interactions and impacts of those on the world. Critically examining contemporary global issues, events, processes and trends from multiple perspectives will improve adaptability and innovative problem solving, and prepare students for careers in public, private, and non-profit organizations where global knowledge, skills and commitment to diversity and sustainability matters. At the same time, a global education can help students develop greater self-awareness of their own identities and how they are connected to the larger world. The minor is highly individualized and can be tailored to enhance many major fields of study and other minor programs.

Major in Integrated Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Master of Professional Accountancy (M.P.A.)
The integrated B.S./M.P.A. Degrees program is primarily oriented toward preparation for professional careers in accounting. Two sequences are offered: (1) Accountancy and Information Systems, and (2) Professional Accountancy. Both sequences permit graduates of the B.S. and M.P.A. degrees to meet minimum education requirements to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination in Illinois.
The 150-hour B.S. (min. 120 hours) and M.P.A. (min. 30 hours of graduate level coursework) integrated program is designed for students wishing to complete both degrees at Illinois State University. The B.S. degree is awarded after completion of the undergraduate degree requirements and the M.P.A. degree is awarded after completion of the graduate degree requirements. The program is not designed to admit students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree.
Students must successfully apply for continuance in the B.S./M.P.A. program in their junior year. Graduate admission would take place after the student has completed approximately 90 hours. Students will be admitted who meet graduate entrance requirements, which include satisfactory performance on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), their previous academic performance, and other evidence of their ability to successfully complete the program. Admission timing is very important to successfully complete the program so students should regularly consult with their Accounting undergraduate or graduate advisor.
Courses completed in the Department of Accounting at this University with grades below C will not count toward the graduation requirements of the Integrated BS/MPA Major, but all grades of D, F, and WX in Accounting courses at this University will be included in computing the cumulative GPA.
Students in the integrated B.S./M.P.A Degrees program must complete one of the following sequences.
Accountancy and Information Systems Sequence
The Accountancy and Information Systems sequence permits students to emphasize study of information systems related to accounting and other business fields.

They do this through supporting healthy environments, promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles, preventing injuries, and preserving and protecting important resources that support human health. Public health is an interdisciplinary field built upon knowledge in environmental health, health behavior/promotion, epidemiology, medicine and other areas of study. This minor provides students with a foundation in key public health courses and, in combination with various majors, can create opportunities for employment in public health settings and graduate study in a Master of Public Health program or other health disciplines.
New and Internal Transfer Requirements: Admission to this academic program is limited and is based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: courses completed, cumulative GPA, hours completed, personal interview or written statement, and samples of work completed.

Facility and Space Use
University Housing Services
University Housing Services
Including Watterson, Cardinal Court, Hewett, Manchester, Haynie, Wright, Wilkins Buildings.
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University’s mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by University Housing Services. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as “facilities and grounds”.) These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, challenge, and learn.
The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.
Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University Housing Services with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location where activities may create safety or health risks.
When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
Scheduling and Using Facilities for University Housing Services
Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve space, in public areas in Hewett, Manchester, Watterson Towers, Cardinal Court, Wilkins, Wright and Haynie Residential spaces, please fill out a Facility Request Form.
For any questions regarding scheduling or facility use in these spaces, please call:
Watterson Towers: (309) 438-0549
Tri-Towers (Wilkins, Wright, Haynie Halls): (309) 438-0639
East Campus (Hewett and Manchester Halls): (309) 438-6038
Cardinal Court: (309) 438-0639
Costs Incurred
The University establishes fee rates for use of University facilities and spaces based on the relationship between the University and the person or organization using the facility. Rental rates may vary depending on whether the individual or organization is considered an RSO, a University organization, an Alumni organization, the public, or a nonprofit charitable organization.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
Administration and Procedural Application
Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Coordinator of Events will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security, staff, insurance requirements, and related loss prevention measures.) Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, including but not limited to:
Priority Use of the facility will be given to University Housing Services staff, University Housing Services Organizations, Registered Student Organizations, study groups. Groups with a higher priority may override a reservation.
51% of attendees must be residents of University Housing Services.
Anticipated attendance, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, and entry fee or registration charge.
The person making the room reservation must be a member of the Registered Student Organization for which they are making the request.
Noise that could be generated from the event and the impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity or residents in adjacent locations.
Impact on traffic and parking.
Adequacy and suitability requested to the location.
Event history, time of the activity, performer history, first time event.
Set-up or clean-up needs, and equipment requested.
Compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and policies.
Potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others.
Presence of minor, food or beverages, animals, media, or technology needs.
Any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section.
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-serve basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Coordinator of Events will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the Vice President for Student Affairs or designee.
Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
University Housing Services will review the event details, assess the event, and determine what measures or requirements are necessary.  University Housing Services must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed.
If certain risks are associated with the proposed event, the following offices may make recommendations to University Housing Services:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events.
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Emergency Management Plan if necessary.
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
University Housing Services recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
Staffing levels may be adjusted, as necessary, based on changing conditions/needs. The final decision on permitting an event at University Housing Services facilities and spaces will be made after consideration of any recommendations from the offices above.
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, set-up costs, staffing charges, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
Food on Campus
Food, beverage, and/or catering is not permitted within University Housing facilities unless pre-authorized to do so in writing. A Food Permit may be required as stated in the University Policy on Sale/Distribution of Food on Campus.
Verification of food permit will be submitted to University Housing Services by the client at least seven (7) business days prior to the event. If not received, no food will be permitted.
Events Involving Minors
If the proposed event or activity will involve minors, the sponsor or group must complete the University Program/Activities Involving Minors registration and comply with the University Protection of Minors Policy.
The registration form will be reviewed and must be approved by the Minors Activity Committee in advance of the event. This confirmation should be sent to University Housing Services.
Solicitation and Sales
Promotion or sales of merchandise is prohibited in University Housing Services facilities. An exception may be made for events with written pre-authorization from University Housing Services. Requests for an exemption should be made no less than seven (7) business days prior to the event or activity.
Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associated with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall “hosting” of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building.
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University’s institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its programs without written authorization.
Violations or Non-Compliance Behavior
Violation of this policy could result in sanctions imposed in accordance with applicable University policies including but not limited to the Student Code of Conduct, University policies applicable to employees, and other available methods. Violations by students and Registered Student Organizations (RSO’s) will be handled through the Student Code of Conduct administered by Student Conduct and Community Responsibilities, a unit of the Dean of Students Office. Violations by employees will be handled by Human Resources. Violations by non-affiliates will be handled by the appropriate agency or department.

University-Wide Teacher Education Program Requirements
University-Wide Teacher Education
Chair, Council for Teacher Education: Dean, College of Education
Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center
Performance-Based Assessment System
Effective Fall 2002, the Council for Teacher Education implemented the Teacher Education Performance-Based Assessment System (PBA). This system meets accreditation standards, as stipulated by the Illinois State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board (ISEPLB) and Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP).
The Performance Based Assessment system (PBA) establishes critical points at which candidates for teacher licensure will be assessed through two gateways:
Gateway 1: Pre-Student Teaching 
Teacher Education Orientation PBA Workshop
National Criminal Background Check (NCBC)- All teacher candidates will be required to complete a one-time, online NCBC. The NCBC reviews criminal histories to ensure the protection of preK-12 students by verifying the teacher candidate has not been convicted of illegal activity nationally.  Results of the NCBC must be reported to the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center before students may begin any clinical experience.  Additionally, the schools in which the teacher candidate will complete their clinical experiences and student teaching assignment(s) will require their own criminal background check be completed.
Clear Illinois Sexual Offender Registry
Clear Violence Against Youth Registry
Cumulative GPA of 2.5 or higher (determined by major)
Communication 110 with a grade of C or better
ENG 101 with a grade of C or better
30 hours of coursework at ISU
Safety Education Assessment
Mandatory Reporter of Child Abuse Training
Pre-Student Teaching Disposition Concerns Assessment
Department approval—given by advisors
Passage of ISBE State Content Test(s)
TB Test
Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI-for World Languages only) 
Gateway 2: Student Teaching
100 Clinical experience hours
50 Diverse clinical hours
Pass Student Teaching (with a grade of C or better)
Student Teaching Disposition Concerns Assessments
Successful completion of a teacher performace assessment as determined by the Illinois State Board of Education, except when waived or eliminated by state legislation. 
The PBA system ensures that candidates possess the knowledge, skills, performances, and dispositions requisite for successful teaching careers. When Illinois State University recommends a candidate for teacher licensure, the entire university has participated in the preparation of that teacher.
Teacher candidates will be required to attend the PBA workshop early in their education program. At this workshop, students will be provided with the information necessary to understand the requirements and how to monitor their progress. Failure to complete certain indicators at required times could delay progress in the intended major. Details regarding the performance-based system can be found on the Teacher Education (PBA) Orientation Workshop website.
The Council for Teacher Education reserves the right to modify performance assessment indicators in response to state and national accreditation mandates to reflect current practice in the teaching profession. Teacher candidates should consult with their program advisors for specific requirements for their major on a regular basis.
Teacher Education Programs Approved by the Illinois State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board (ISEPLB)
The following is a list of education programs offered by Illinois State University which may lead to licensure. For specific courses and program details, please consult the University's Majors website.

Theatre
The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) grants teacher/school licenses in the State of Illinois. All teacher candidates who successfully complete an approved teacher education program at Illinois State University, pass appropriate licensure exams, and meet ISBE requirements will be recommended for licensure. This does not lead to licensure in other states. Teacher candidates are responsible for checking the requirements of the state in question.
Endorsements are available at the graduate level for Chief School Business Official, Director of Special Education, Learning Behavior Specialist II, Low Vision/Blindness, Library Information Specialist, Principal, Reading Specialist, School Psychologist, School Social Worker, Speech and Language Pathologist, Superintendent, and School Nursing.
Each student who completes a bachelor’s degree program in an approved Teacher Education program, and who is recommended for licensure by the licensure officer at Illinois State University as having completed all requirements (General Education, Professional Education, field of study or area of specialization, and general teacher education requirements, and all other applicable degree requirements), is recommended for a teaching license in the State of Illinois. The Evaluations Office at Illinois State University will notify students of the correct procedures for applying for the appropriate Illinois teaching license. Application to ISBE for licensure should occur within one year of this notification. Failure to do so may result in no longer meeting licensure requirements due to state law changes. To satisfy Illinois licensure requirements and Illinois State University’s Gateway System requirements, all candidates must pass a subject matter knowledge test and a teacher performance assessment (except when waived or eliminated by state legislation). Additional tests may be required for select licensure programs and additional endorsements.
Students who have already completed one or more non-teaching degrees and now seek admission to a teacher education program are advised to seek admission to the University as a candidate for a second bachelor’s degree. Subsequent transcript analysis may determine that a second degree is not required. In this instance, the student will be allowed to complete the requirements for licensure without completing the requirements of the second bachelor’s degree.
General Education
As part of the entitlement program, the Illinois State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board will accept the same general education requirements for licensure as are accepted for graduation from that university.
Endorsements
The minimum requirements for all teaching fields and all endorsements are defined by the State of Illinois. One or more endorsements may be earned along with the completion of the teaching major by taking additional courses and a possible state test. Students should contact an advisor for information on requirements for endorsements.
Council for Teacher Education
The Council for Teacher Education is responsible for developing requirements for Teacher Education and for providing avenues of communication among all of the areas of the University concerned with teacher education.
Time Limit on Teacher Education Courses
To provide teacher candidates with current information and meet required standards, all undergraduate teacher education courses have a longevity of seven (7) years. Any teacher education program reserves the right not to accept any course older than seven years to fulfill the requirements of their program. If a course has been taken beyond a seven-year period, the course may not count towards the education degree.
Dismissal from Programs
Teacher candidates who fail to comply with teacher education requirements may be dismissed. At the option of the department or school, teacher candidates dropped from the program may pursue a degree in a non-teaching major or be classified “undeclared.”
If a student is dismissed from a teacher education program, they have a right to appeal this decision to the Council for Teacher Education. The appeal process is outlined on the Cecilia J. Lauby 
Teacher Education Center website under the heading "Rights and Responsibilities." 
Teacher candidates convicted of certain types of crimes may not be approved for licensure by the Illinois State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board.
 Clinical Experiences in Teacher Education
A variety of clinical (pre-student teaching) experiences, as well as student teaching, are included in the teacher candidate's professional preparation. Observations, small and large group instruction, tutoring, field experiences, and student teaching are included in the Clinical Experiences Program. The experiences offered prior to student teaching are integral parts of specific college courses. Clinical experiences are provided in off-campus professional development schools, local schools, campus laboratory schools, agencies, and other approved school and non-school settings. The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center monitors and documents all clinical experiences. Teacher candidates will show verification of having completed clinical experiences commensurate with attaining local, state, and national standards. Teacher candidates must provide their own transportation to clinical experiences sites.
Candidates are required to provide documentation of meeting all State of Illinois, district, and university requirements regarding criminal background checks BEFORE beginning any clinical experiences. Criminal background checks must remain current as of the last day of the clinical experience. Additionally, the schools in which the teacher candidate will complete their clinical experiences and student teaching assignments may require their own criminal background check be completed. 
The approximate number of clinical hours may be found with the appropriate course description in this Undergraduate Catalog. Clinical Experiences may consist of the following: observation (including field trips), tutoring, non-instructional assisting, small group instruction, whole class instruction, work with clinic client(s), and professional meetings.
Every program has a required set of clinical hours which will be completed in conjunction with specific courses. Of these pre-student teaching clinical hours, 50 hours must be in a diverse setting. Learn more about diverse clinical hours on the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center website. Prior to beginning any clinical experience and student teaching, every teacher candidate must complete a National Criminal Background Check (NCBC) through the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center (56 DeGarmo Hall).  
Student Teaching Requirements
During the student teaching semester, the teacher candidate will be involved with directing the learning of pupils, participating in school and community activities, and assuming full responsibility for a group of learners supervised by a cooperating teacher. Student teaching assignments are made based on the teacher candidate’s area of specialization.
The number of semester hours required for student teaching varies with the teacher candidate’s program of study. The student teaching assignment is completed in the candidate’s major field of study and is the culminating experience in the teacher education program.
The following requirements must be met prior to participation in student teaching.
1. Approval for student teaching by the Director of The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center. This approval will include verification of the following:
Completion of pre-student teaching clinical experiences commensurate with the local, state, and national standards;
An application for student teaching filed in The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center at least 6 months prior to the planned student teaching semester;
Satisfactory completion of prerequisite courses to STT 399. (See University-wide courses);
Meeting all requirements for Gateway 1 - Pre-Student Teaching as stated in the Performance-based Assessment System. All requirements for Admission to Student Teaching must be met by December 15 for student teaching during the spring semester and by July 15 for student teaching during the fall semester.
2. Approval for student teaching will be granted by the candidate’s major department chairperson or school director or designee. This approval may be based on the following criteria that the teacher candidate:
Has demonstrated content knowledge in the student’s major area of study;
Has a grade of C or better in all major coursework (that leads to licensure) and all professional education coursework;
Possesses professional knowledge necessary for performing teaching responsibilities;
Has performed at an acceptable level during the pre-student teaching clinical experiences;
Shows evidence of professional characteristics and interpersonal skills necessary for working with children and youth; and
Has completed all other departmental or school requirements, including a minimum major GPA (see major department or school for additional requirements).
Student Teaching Assignments
The University will assign student teachers to selected schools or professional development schools (PDS) in Illinois during regular semesters. Personnel of The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center, in cooperation with the major department or school, secure the student teaching placement(s). Teacher candidates may not self-place and are responsible for their own living arrangements and transportation to and from the student teaching location. Student teachers are assigned only to classrooms that have regularly employed full time and fully qualified teachers. Assignments are not made to a school in which the teacher candidate or a family member is currently or has been employed. 
During the student teaching semester, the teacher candidate works with one or more cooperating teachers who are responsible for teaching a specific group or groups of pupils. These cooperating teachers, along with the University supervisors, have responsibility for guiding and evaluating the work of the student teachers. During this experience, the student teacher becomes a member of the school staff and the community in which they are working. Any student teacher who is unable to continue their student teaching assignment should consult with the Director of the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center immediately. Any student with a disability who needs a reasonable accommodation to complete their student teaching assignment should contact the Office of Student Access and Accommodation Services as soon as possible at 350 Fell Hall, (309) 438-5853. 
The Director of The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center, upon the recommendation of the University supervisor, chairperson or director of the student’s major department or school administrator, may remove a student from the assignment. A student teacher may be required to do additional coursework, engage in remedial activities, and/or complete an extended or additional student teaching experience until the candidate is sufficiently competent to be recommended for licensure. 
Student teaching assignments begin and end on the dates indicated on the student teacher’s official notice of assignment. The student teacher is expected to follow the calendar of the school in which they are completing their student teaching assignment including vacations and school holidays. Changes in dates involved in an assignment must receive prior permission of the Director of The Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center.
To be recommended for licensure, a teacher education candidate must earn a grade of C or better in student teaching to meet all requirements for Gateway 2: Student Teaching.
Graduation Requirement for All Teacher Education Majors
All teacher candidates must graduate with a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 2.50.
Licensure for Persons Who Have Been Convicted of a Crime
Entitlement for licensure is not an automatic procedure. The Undergraduate Evaluation Office will notify the Illinois State Board of Education when an Illinois State University candidate has completed all major degree requirements and all requirements identified in the Performance-Based Assessment System for all teacher education candidates. The Illinois State Board of Education makes the final decision in awarding of a teaching license. Additional considerations may preclude Illinois licensure.
If the answer to any of the statements below is “yes,” the teacher candidate may not be eligible for licensure in the State of Illinois. All statements refer to offenses in Illinois or any other state.
Have you ever had a teaching license or certificate denied, suspended or revoked in any state or country?

Have you ever been convicted of any of the following:
Felony
Sex Offense
Drug or narcotic offense

Lauby Teacher Education Center website and contact the Director of the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center, 56 DeGarmo Hall.

Our hometown got its name from “Illinois State Normal University,” our old moniker. Back then, we were a teachers’ college and “normal” meant teaching.

Admitted Transfer Students
Already admitted? Congratulations!
As a transfer student, you’re an important part of our campus community. We want you to start your transfer on the right track. You probably have a lot of questions about your next steps. Review the acceptance letter that has been emailed to you with your next steps.
Activate Your Admitted Student Account
Now that you’ve been admitted, many of the steps on this checklist will require you to access your admitted student account. To begin, follow the activation steps at IllinoisState.edu/Activate.
You’ll need your University ID (UID), which is included in your acceptance letter that was emailed to you.
Activate Admitted Student Account
My.IllinoisState.edu
Once you've activated your account, take your next steps at My.IllinoisState.edu, where your personalized to-do list will be updated with your relevant requirements.
Visit My.IllinoisState.edu
Apply for Financial Aid
Your first step is completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA is available beginning December, and we encourage you to complete it as soon as possible for full consideration.  Financial aid offer letters will be sent during the month of April for summer/fall students and the month of October for spring students if the FAFSA and all requested documents have been submitted.
Our student employment fairs and ISU Jobs online database make it easy to find employment—a great source of additional financial support.

Need to Take a Math Placement Assessment?
Your Illinois State academic advisor will help you determine whether you need to take the assessment. Before you register for a math class at Illinois State, you must either take the ALEKS Math Placement Assessment or complete an appropriate prerequisite course with a grade of C or better.
Submit a Housing and Meal Plan Contract

Notes
A maximum 6 hours of POL 398a01, IDS 398a02 and LGS 398a20 may count toward major.
Accelerated master 's degree (AMD) programs offer high achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor 's degree and master 's degree in a faster time frame than each degree separately. Students will take both graduate and undergraduate classes when they have junior or senior status and seamlessly transition into their master 's degree program. Students admitted into an accelerated master 's degree program may count a maximum of twelve (12) hours or 33% of course work (whichever is higher) towards both the bachelor 's degree and master 's degree. The coursework requires approval of the academic advisor.
Students must complete at least one graduate course as an undergraduate to be considered in the accelerated master’s degree program. If the student does not complete at least one graduate course, or chooses to withdraw from the accelerated program, they will be placed back in their original degree program.

Admissions Information
Illinois State University School of Social Work completes criminal background checks for all BSW and MSW candidates and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic record and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon successfully completing and passing a national background check. The school may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to the MSW/BSW program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some field instruction placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the MSW/BSW degree. Many agencies require criminal background checks as a condition for accepting a placement in their program. It is the student's responsibility to inquire with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to the MSW/BSW program, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the School of Social Work. Students must meet the criteria for professional and ethical behavior as set forth by the School of Social Work.
A 60-hour, two-year program for fulltime students, students may also choose part-time programs and should consult with the advisor. New students who have undergraduate degrees in fields other than social work or from non-accredited schools of social work complete the full program. Students with undergraduate social work degrees from programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education may be given advanced standing and complete the 30-hour advanced curriculum.
NOTE: Academic credit for life experience and/or previous work experience is not given, in whole or in part, in lieu of any social work course.

Please consult this Graduate Catalog and the program coordinator in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology for details.
Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Graduate Certificate
For Social Work Students
The WGSS graduate certificate sequence offer students a conceptual vocabulary for recognizing the intricacies of power and teaches them to identify the barriers that hold social inequalities in place. The sequence’s intersectional approach to social issues increases cultural competency by providing practitioners with a working social justice conceptual toolkit that is easily integrated in their professional work.
This 12-hour graduate certificate encourages social work practitioners not only to understand more fully the daily obstacles their clients face, but also to empower their clients by providing them with the skills they need to succeed. Please consult this Graduate Catalog and the WGSS program advisor for details.
Post-MSW Professional Educator License Graduate Certificate
Interested students who have previously completed a master's in social work degree but wish to obtain a professional educator license with a "school social worker endorsement" from the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) may complete the required coursework and a school social work practicum placement. The program is offered part-time over 2 years; the first year consisting solely of coursework and the second year consisting of a 700 hour practicum placement in a school setting with a school social worker and a concurrent seminar course. During the program, students also complete the required social work "content exam" and reading modules, which allows them to be eligible to apply for and obtain licensure from ISBE upon completion of the certificate program. Thus, when all course and field practicum requirements are met, students submit their application to ISBE to receive their "professional educator license (PEL) with a school social work endorsement".

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

 Minor in Ethnic Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies.

Freshman Admission Requirements
Our commitment to individual attention reaches beyond the classroom into the admissions process. To determine your academic preparedness and fit, all elements of your application will be reviewed carefully by a University professional.
Highest admission priority will be granted to students with the strongest academic records.
What Admissions Considers
High school courses completed
Grade point average
SAT/ACT scores and subscores (if submitted)
Optional academic personal statement
Academic Completion
You are required to complete a core high school curriculum that includes:
English - 8 semesters
Emphasizing written and oral communications and literature
Mathematics - 6 semesters 
 We encourage college readiness courses like algebra, geometry, trigonometry, or fundamentals of computer programming.
Science – 4 semesters  with laboratories
Emphasizing natural science or agricultural science
Social science – 4 semesters 
Emphasizing history and government
Foreign language/Fine arts – 4 semesters 
Any combination of four semesters of a language and/or fine arts, including art or music.
Grade Point Average
You’ll be required to submit a self-reported grade point average.
The middle 50% range for fall 2024 admitted freshmen was 3.3 – 4.0.
 Academic Personal Statement
All applicants are welcome to submit a personal statement for review, though it is not required to complete your application. This statement may be considered along with other application materials to determine eligibility for admission. If you opt not to submit a statement and further review is needed to make an admission decision, we will request a personal statement from you at that time.
If you would like to submit a personal statement, your submission should be approximately 500 words in length and address the contributions you are prepared to make to our community, both academically and otherwise. Specifically, your statement should:
Identify any circumstances that affected your high school academic performance, if applicable
Make clear your commitment to academic success in college, acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses and your plans to utilize available resources
Articulate your readiness to engage productively in our campus community outside the classroom
Standardized Test Scores
You are not required to submit a standardized test score as part of your application for admission.
You will still have the option to submit an SAT or ACT score—and if you were to do so, it could not affect your standing negatively.
Applicants who opt not to include an SAT or ACT score will be required to submit a high school transcript in order to complete their application for admission. For students whose application requires further review, additional information such as an academic personal statement may be requested.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

Admissions Information
Illinois State University’s Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders completes criminal background checks for all candidates for the Master’s Program in Speech-Language Pathology and the Doctoral Program in Audiology and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic records, and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon completing and passing a national background check. The department may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to a CSD graduate program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some clinical placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the advanced degree. Many clinical sites require criminal background checks for accepting a student clinician in their setting. It is the student’s responsibility to inquire with the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to a graduate program in CSD, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders. Students must meet the professional and ethical standards set forth by the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders.
In addition to the requirements of the Graduate School, the degree students must meet all the academic requirements and clinical practicum requirements for the Certificate of Clinical Competence of the American Speech-LanguageHearing Association. Copies of requirements for both Illinois and national certification 
can be found online. The graduate programs are accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation.
Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.00 in major courses and overall to retain their degree status and to be eligible for department clinicals. Enrollment by graduate students in the department's clinicals requires degree status. In all instances, permission of the Clinic Director is needed for practicum enrollment, and enrollments may be restricted. External graduate clinicals may require special coursework and will require a student to provide transportation to external settings arranged by the department.
A candidate for the master's degree must 
complete two external placements
 in order to qualify for the degree. A degree student in the Doctor of Audiology program must spend one year in residency in order to qualify for the degree. A year in residence is interpreted as three consecutive semesters
 of enrollment in CSD 598.90 for one credit hour each semester.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Admission to the English major may be affected and restricted by the lack of available Department resources in times of oversubscription. Students in the major and all sequences must pass ENG 100 with a C or better in order to advance and complete the program. 
For information about admission to this program visit the 
University’s Academics website
.
The Accelerated English Education Sequence (AEES) is an Accelerated Master's Degree (AMD) program, which serves as a pathway to the Master's in English Education. This AMD is designed for undergraduate teacher education students who, when they graduate with their undergraduate degree, will pursue employment as secondary English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. Qualifying students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher may apply to the AEES once they have reached junior status. Admission is based on competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures are available on the English Education website and applications are considered on a rotating basis each fall and spring semester. Acceptance into the AEES constitutes acceptance into the MA/MS in English Education. To transfer to graduate-only status after completing the BA in English Education, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the MA/MS in English Education. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing.

Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of English participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the following minors: African Studies, African-American Studies, Children’s Studies, Civic Engagement and Responsibility, Cognitive Science, Ethnic Studies, European Studies, International Studies, Latin American and Latino/a Studies, Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies, Native American Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and also the Minor in Religious Studies in the Department of Philosophy. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs and Department of Philosophy sections.
Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing. By providing a broad work experience, students not only build their portfolios, but also enter the marketplace with valuable and current skills.
View Publishing Studies Sequence Course Requirements
Technical Writing and Rhetorics Sequence
Technical Writing and Rhetorics is a sequence in the English major. Professional technical writers take complex information and communicate it in a way that people understand. Focusing on this sequence prepares you for a career as a technical and professional writer in a variety of settings, such as corporate, nonprofit, and governmental organizations. You will develop the skills and knowledges needed to communicate specialized information effectively to a range of audiences. The sequence offers degrees in both the B.A. and the B.S.
View Technical Writing and Rhetorics Sequence Course Requirements
English Teacher Education Sequence

Admission to the English Teacher Education Sequence is limited and is based on cohort space availability and competitiveness of the applicant.
A 3.00 GPA in the major, a 2.5 cumulative GPA, a grade of C or better in all required major courses, and adherence to all application procedures and deadlines is required for admission to Professional Studies and Student Teaching.

Major in Sociology
Sociology majors at Illinois State explore a diverse range of topics and learn to think critically about the social world. Our distinguished faculty members are committed to helping students develop the analytical skills they need to gain a deeper understanding of the world in which we live.
Sociologists look under the surface of social life. They analyze data and develop theories in order to understand and explain social patterns, issues, and problems. Sociology not only helps us understand the roots of these issues and problems, but can also help inform policies that contribute to their solutions.

SOC 106
15 credit hours of electives, 9 credit hours must be at the 200- or 300-level.

Anthropology
Degree Offered: B.A., B.S.
Major in Anthropology
Anthropology is a discipline concerned with people in their entirety: our evolution and physical variation, the remnants of our prehistoric past, the cultural and linguistic diversity of human societies past and present.
Anthropology has four subfields: archaeology, anthropological linguistics, cultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. An anthropological education begins with learning the fundamentals. This means taking courses representative of all four subfields.
Students in the Anthropology major must complete one of the following sequences.
Anthropology Sequence
View Anthropology Course Requirements
Accelerated Anthropology Sequence
View Accelerated Anthropology Course Requirements
Program Admission Requirements
The Accelerated Anthropology Sequence (AAS) is a pathway to the Master’s Program in Anthropology. Accelerated degree programs offer high-achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor’s degree and master’s degree with one additional year of study. Students accepted to the sequence will be allowed to take courses during their senior year that will count toward both the undergraduate and graduate programs in anthropology. Qualifying students must apply to the AAS in the spring semester of their junior year. Admission is based on space availability and competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures and deadlines are available on the Anthropology Program website.
Acceptance into the AAS constitutes acceptance into the Master’s Program in Anthropology and thus students will take up to 12 hours of graduate-level credits during their senior year. To transfer to graduate-only status for their second year, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the Master’s Program in Anthropology in the spring of their senior year. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing and have made good progress towards their M.A. degree during their senior year.
A maximum of 12 of the total 15 hours of elective courses may be taken for graduate credit
Some 300-level courses are offered for undergraduate or graduate credit. Students in the Accelerated Sequence who want to count a 300-level course toward their 12 hours of required graduate coursework, must enroll in the 300-level course for graduate credit at the beginning of the course in order for it to count.
To graduate in this sequence, a student must take at least one course for graduate credit during the senior year. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure approval.
Notes
The following anthropology courses may be taken by anthropology majors to fulfill General Education requirements but do not count towards electives for the major: ANT 143, ANT 176, ANT 197
All anthropology majors are encouraged to take SOC 275 (Social Statistics) as part of their undergraduate curriculum, however no Sociology courses may be counted toward the 40 hours in Anthropology required for the major
Special topics courses (ANT 306 and ANT 383) vary from semester to semester may be taken twice for credit if the content is different.
All Graduate School admission deadlines and policies apply to courses for graduate credit
Minor in Anthropology
18 total credit hours in Anthropology required
Required courses
ANT 102

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors

Admission/Retention Requirements
A student may enter a major or minor in the School of Information Technology as a new freshman, a transfer student, or as a change of major at Illinois State University. Students should contact the Information Technology undergraduate advisor or University Admissions for minimum admission requirements.
For Computer Science and Information Systems Transfer Students: Proficiency with the Java programming language is expected in 200-and 300-level Information Technology courses and is usually obtained by completing IT 168 and one of IT 178, IT 179 or IT 275.For Cybersecurity and Computer Networking Transfer Students: An IT 168 equivalent can be completed in Java or C++.
For any student who enrolls in a course in the School of Information Technology, a grade of C or better is required in all prerequisite courses. For majors, only courses in which the student has received a grade of C or better may be counted toward the hours required in the major, including supporting requirements. A student cannot pursue a double major in any two programs in the School of Information Technology. Also, a student cannot pursue both a major and a minor in Information Technology.
The School of Information Technology (IT) offers four degree programs: Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Computer Networking. All IT majors require substantial interpersonal written and verbal communication skills as well as technical computing skills. The curricula have a strong practical emphasis on the application of computing solutions to real world problems. Practical skills and applications are balanced with exposure to the theoretical knowledge base that underlies the field of computing.
All programs prepare a student for a computing career, but there are important differences in the context of the work to be performed, the types of problems to be solved, and the types of systems to be designed and built. Computer Science focuses on algorithm development and writing programs that others will use.  Cybersecurity focuses on all aspects of information assurance, including protecting networks, servers, databases, and private information.  Information Systems focuses on integrating hardware and software authored by others into a coherent system to fulfill a business purpose.  Computer Networking prepares students to build and optimize networks for best performance.
Starting positions for Computer Science and Information Systems include such job titles as programmer or programmer/analyst. Cybersecurity graduates will take jobs as security analysts, while Computer Networking titles include network administrator and network technician.
Department minors are intended to help majors in other departments focus on specific skills and electives which are relevant for their career needs. Minors are available in Information Systems and in Computer Science.
Each degree program requires a practical experience that may be satisfied by a directed project or an internship. An internship experience is the usual way for students to satisfy this requirement. IT 191 (1 hour) is required and prepares students for fulfilling this requirement. It is recommended that IT 191 be taken no later than the sophomore year. 
The six (6) hours of Professional Practice credit counted toward the major will be graded. Any additional Professional Practice credit will be earned on a CR/NC basis. A maximum of 16 hours of Professional Practice credit (IT 391, IT 398) may be applied toward graduation. Students may not register for IT 398 during the last semester of their studies.
The School of Information Technology participates in the Minor in Cognitive Science program. Several courses offered by the School contribute to the minor. For further information, please consult the School undergraduate advisor as well as Interdisciplinary Studies Programs section.

The Accelerated English Education Sequence (AEES) is an Accelerated Master's Degree (AMD) program, which serves as a pathway to the Master's in English Education. This AMD is designed for undergraduate teacher education students who, when they graduate with their undergraduate degree, will pursue employment as secondary English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. Qualifying students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher may apply to the AEES once they have reached junior status. Admission is based on competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures are available on the English Education website and applications are considered on a rotating basis each fall and spring semester. Acceptance into the AEES constitutes acceptance into the MA/MS in English Education. To transfer to graduate-only status after completing the BA in English Education, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the MA/MS in English Education. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing.

The Department of English participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the following minors: African Studies, African-American Studies, Children’s Studies, Civic Engagement and Responsibility, Cognitive Science, Ethnic Studies, European Studies, International Studies, Latin American and Latino/a Studies, Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies, Native American Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and also the Minor in Religious Studies in the Department of Philosophy. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs and Department of Philosophy sections.
Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing. By providing a broad work experience, students not only build their portfolios, but also enter the marketplace with valuable and current skills.

Focusing on this sequence prepares you for a career as a technical and professional writer in a variety of settings, such as corporate, nonprofit, and governmental organizations.

New Start Program
New Start Program
The New Start program is offered to students who wish to return to Illinois State after being away for a minimum of one year and who left with less than a 2.0 grade point average.
New Start offers students many benefits upon their return. Most significantly, it allows students to begin a new cumulative grade point average upon readmission into the University. To discuss your eligibility to return via the New Start program, contact University College at (309) 438-3217.

Requirements
Students may be considered for readmission through New Start if they left Illinois State with less than a 2.0 GPA, have been away from the University for one full year (for example, a student who last attended the University the spring 2017 term cannot re-enroll through New Start until the fall 2018 term), and meet the requirements of one of the following New Start categories:
Nontraditional Student
Veteran
Community College Transfer
Nontraditional Student
Former Illinois State students at least 25 years of age may be considered for readmission through this option after being away for one full year. If they have attended any college (including their time at Illinois State) in the three calendar years preceding re-enrollment at Illinois State, they must have achieved at least a cumulative 2.5 GPA for that college work. Transfer credit will be evaluated and appropriately awarded.
Veteran
Former Illinois State students who complete at least a one-year tour of duty since leaving Illinois State and who present a discharge for reasons other than dishonorable and who haven’t attended another college or university between discharge and application for readmission to Illinois State may be considered for readmission through this option.
Community College Transfer
Former Illinois State students who earned 60 or fewer hours at Illinois State prior to enrolling at a community college may be considered for readmission through this option. To qualify as a community college transfer candidate for the New Start program, you must have earned at least 24 hours after being away for one full year, earned a currently accepted associate’s degree (A.A. or A.S.) from a community college, and have at least a 2.5 cumulative GPA since leaving Illinois State. Students pursuing this option should also meet the 
transfer admission requirements
 for their intended major. Transfer credit will be evaluated and appropriately awarded.
For more information on the three categories that qualify for the New Start program, please see the Undergraduate Catalog.
Application Process
To discuss your eligibility to return via the New Start Program, contact University College at (309) 438-3217.
In order to be considered for admission through the New Start Program, follow these steps:
Apply for admission.
Submit official academic transcript(s) from all schools attended since leaving Illinois State. Transcripts should be mailed to the Office of Admissions, Illinois State University, Campus Box 2200, Normal, IL 61790-2200.
As part of the application process, you will be asked to write a statement describing your potential to do well academically. Your statement will be reviewed along with all other documentation submitted.
Your statement should indicate your strategy for achieving academic success if readmitted to the University.
Your statement should include the steps you have taken to ensure that you can successfully pursue and complete your intended major. In addition, you should provide a summary of the requirements to be admitted into your intended major.
Your statement should be no more than 500 words.
Program Conditions
As a student returning to Illinois State via the New Start program, please be aware of the following conditions of the program.
Advisement
If you are an undeclared student, you are advised by University College Academic Advisement in Fell Hall 340, (309) 438-7604. If you have a declared major, contact your major department/school for advisement. Refer to your official letter of Admissions to verify your major.
Grade Point Average
Upon your return to Illinois State, your cumulative grade point average will be recalculated using all grades earned from your point of reentry. The New Start option impacts only your cumulative grade point average and does not change your major and/or minor grade point average. Previous credits earned are still applied toward your degree requirements and will be posted on your transcript. Additionally, all grades earned at Illinois State, including those earned prior to New Start admission, will be used in determining eligibility for graduation honors.
Major
New Start applicants may be considered for admission directly into a major, if space in the major is available and if all major admission requirements are met at the time of enrollment. If this criterion is not met, New Start students will be admitted as an undeclared student. Refer to your official letter of Admissions to verify your major.
Academic Status
As a New Start student, you are on academic probation until you reestablish a cumulative grade point average that is above a 2.0/4.0. All New Start students are required to participate in Project Success. If your cumulative grade point average drops below a 2.0/4.0 at any point in your academic future at Illinois State, you will be dismissed from the University. Please be aware that you may only exercise the New Start option one time.
Course Load
As a student on academic probation, it is strongly recommended that you discuss your course load with your academic advisor. Additionally, you are encouraged to consider your ability to balance your course load with other obligations (i.e. work schedule, family, etc.) to ensure your personal academic success. Therefore, it is strongly suggested to enroll in no more than 14 credit hours.
Catalog Year
You will follow the Undergraduate Catalog in effect at the time you are returning to the University as a New Start student.
Graduation Hours
To be eligible for graduation, you must earn at least 30 semester hours at Illinois State after returning as a New Start student. You will need to discuss graduation requirements with your advisor.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Admission to the English major may be affected and restricted by the lack of available Department resources in times of oversubscription. Students in the major and all sequences must pass ENG 100 with a C or better in order to advance and complete the program. 
For information about admission to this program visit the

.
The Accelerated English Education Sequence (AEES) is an Accelerated Master's Degree (AMD) program, which serves as a pathway to the Master's in English Education. This AMD is designed for undergraduate teacher education students who, when they graduate with their undergraduate degree, will pursue employment as secondary English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. Qualifying students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher may apply to the AEES once they have reached junior status. Admission is based on competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures are available on the English Education website and applications are considered on a rotating basis each fall and spring semester. Acceptance into the AEES constitutes acceptance into the MA/MS in English Education. To transfer to graduate-only status after completing the BA in English Education, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the MA/MS in English Education. This application to the Graduate School will be considered pro-forma if students are in good standing.

Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the following minors: African Studies, African-American Studies, Children’s Studies, Civic Engagement and Responsibility, Cognitive Science, Ethnic Studies, European Studies, International Studies, Latin American and Latino/a Studies, Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies, Native American Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and also the Minor in Religious Studies in the Department of Philosophy. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs and Department of Philosophy sections.
Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing. By providing a broad work experience, students not only build their portfolios, but also enter the marketplace with valuable and current skills.

Honors in Economics
Candidates for honors must fulfill the general requirements for participation in the University Honors Program and must be Economics majors with a GPA of 3.30 overall and 3.75 or higher in Economics courses. Students will be expected to complete six hours of coursework designated as honors coursework within the Department of Economics. These could include ECO 101 and ECO 102 honors, or 2 in-course honors at the 200- or 300-level. In-course honors requires individual negotiation with the faculty member teaching the course.

At the end of the semester the student will make an oral presentation of the paper. One copy of the original paper will be kept in the Department office and be available for inspection. Honors credit will show on the official transcript and will be stated on the diploma.

General Education Program Requirements
General Education Requirements
General Education provides students with a broad, common foundation of study upon which to build an undergraduate education. The program develops skills of oral and written communication, logical and scientific reasoning, and quantitative analysis. Courses in General Education explore ways of knowing in the various disciplines through examination of significant historical, social, cultural, and scientific issues. Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses.
General Education Requirement Options
There are three ways to complete general education requirements for Illinois State University. These three general education programs have different requirements and affect only certain types of students.
1. Complete Illinois State University's General Education Program. The General Education Program requires 13 courses (39 semester hours).
View courses that satisfy ISU's General Education Program
The following categories of students must complete the Illinois State University General Education Program requirements:
Beginning Freshmen (refer to the Admissions section of this catalog for complete definition).
Students who were admitted as beginning freshmen at Illinois State University, who were readmitted and who have not completed a baccalaureate-oriented associate’s degree (A.A. or A.S.—the A.S. must include the complete IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) package) from an Illinois public community college and are not eligible for an earlier catalog.
Transfer Students who have not completed a baccalaureate-oriented associates degree (A.A. or A.S.) from a regionally accredited post-secondary institution and who are not eligible to complete the IAI General Education Core Curriculum package described below.
2. Complete the Illinois General Education Core Curriculum package available through the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI).
View ISU courses that satisfy the IAI General Education Core Curriculum package
This program is a statewide agreement between participating public colleges and universities and some private schools that is designed to facilitate timely degree completion for students who transfer between institutions. The Illinois Transferable General Education Core Curriculum Package structure consists of 12 to 13 courses (37 to 41 semester credits) distributed among five subject areas. Completion of these courses at any participating institution satisfies general education requirements for Illinois State University. The IAI GECC Package is presented in the section entitled General Education - Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI). More information about this system and participating institutions can be found at iTransfer.org. 
The following categories of students may complete the Illinois General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) package:
Transfer students (See Admissions section of this catalog for a complete description) who began the Illinois General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) at a participating IAI institution and transferred to Illinois State may choose to complete the program by enrolling in Illinois State approved IAI courses presented in the section entitled Illinois Articulation Initiative Courses at Illinois State. Transfer students should note, however, that IAI course availability may be limited.
Transfer students who have completed at least one transfer course that is articulated to an IAI General Education Core Curriculum requirement.
Students who have completed the Illinois General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) package at a participating IAI institution are considered to have met Illinois State University's General Education requirements.
3. 
 Complete a baccalaureate-oriented Associates Degree (A.A. or A.S.) from a regionally accredited post-secondary institution.
For those transferring from an 
Illinois college or university, the A.S. degree must include the complete IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) package or the student must complete the IAI GECC package to fulfill Illinois State’s General Education requirement.
Any transfer student may choose to complete Illinois State University's General Education Program and should speak with an academic advisor regarding documentation of that change on their academic record.

Freshman Admission Requirements
Our commitment to individual attention reaches beyond the classroom into the admissions process. To determine your academic preparedness and fit, all elements of your application will be reviewed carefully by a University professional.
Highest admission priority will be granted to students with the strongest academic records.
What Admissions Considers
High school courses completed
Grade point average
SAT/ACT scores and subscores (if submitted)
Optional academic personal statement
Academic Completion
You are required to complete a core high school curriculum that includes:
English - 8 semesters
Emphasizing written and oral communications and literature
Mathematics - 6 semesters 
 We encourage college readiness courses like algebra, geometry, trigonometry, or fundamentals of computer programming.
Science – 4 semesters  with laboratories
Emphasizing natural science or agricultural science
Social science – 4 semesters 
Emphasizing history and government
Foreign language/Fine arts – 4 semesters 
Any combination of four semesters of a language and/or fine arts, including art or music.
Grade Point Average
You’ll be required to submit a self-reported grade point average.
The middle 50% range for fall 2024 admitted freshmen was 3.3 – 4.0.
 Academic Personal Statement
All applicants are welcome to submit a personal statement for review, though it is not required to complete your application. This statement may be considered along with other application materials to determine eligibility for admission. If you opt not to submit a statement and further review is needed to make an admission decision, we will request a personal statement from you at that time.
If you would like to submit a personal statement, your submission should be approximately 500 words in length and address the contributions you are prepared to make to our community, both academically and otherwise. Specifically, your statement should:
Identify any circumstances that affected your high school academic performance, if applicable
Make clear your commitment to academic success in college, acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses and your plans to utilize available resources
Articulate your readiness to engage productively in our campus community outside the classroom
Standardized Test Scores
You are not required to submit a standardized test score as part of your application for admission.
You will still have the option to submit an SAT or ACT score—and if you were to do so, it could not affect your standing negatively.
Applicants who opt not to include an SAT or ACT score will be required to submit a high school transcript in order to complete their application for admission. For students whose application requires further review, additional information such as an academic personal statement may be requested.

A chemistry or math course in the major may not be attempted more than twice during a student’s undergraduate career. An exception may be requested only once for only one course during a student's undergraduate career if the GPA in the major plan is 2.00 or higher, and the overall GPA is 2.00 or higher. A student who does not complete the course with a grade of C or better on the third attempt will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Any student who would need an additional third enrollment to enroll in any other required chemistry or math course in the major will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Each attempt in which the student receives a grade, including a grade of WX, is counted as an attempt.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Students are required to take a core of two courses on African-American history and literature, as well as elective courses in the social sciences (History, Sociology, and Politics and Government) and in the humanities and fine arts (English, Music, and Theatre and Dance), and in interdisciplinary programs (including relevant course offerings in Interdisciplinary Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies).

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

The Minor provides a comprehensive and in-depth approach to peace and conflict resolution theories and methods. Students are required to take an introductory course, as well as one course from each of four areas of inquiry (social justice, violence prevention and conflict resolution, environmental justice, and globalization), while also specializing in one of these areas with two additional courses. The minor's capstone experience is a professional practice.
The Minor allows students to examine the causes and prevention of war, as well as the nature of violence, including social oppression, discrimination and marginalization. They also learn peace strategies to overcome persecution and transform society to attain a more just and equitable international community. The inquiry encompasses micro to macro perspectives. At the micro end of the spectrum, students investigate non-violent ethics and conflict management; interpersonal communication and relations; intergroup relations; and diversity and gender issues. At the macro level, students explore the dynamics of international conflict, as well as approaches to peace and world order; ethnic and socioeconomic justice; multiculturism; renewable economics; and biodiversity.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

Professional Accountancy
Major in Integrated Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Master of Professional Accountancy (M.P.A.)
The integrated B.S./M.P.A. Degrees program is primarily oriented toward preparation for professional careers in accounting. Two sequences are offered: (1) Accountancy and Information Systems, and (2) Professional Accountancy. Both sequences permit graduates of the B.S. and M.P.A. degrees to meet minimum education requirements to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination in Illinois.
The 150-hour B.S. (min. 120 hours) and M.P.A. (min. 30 hours of graduate level coursework) integrated program is designed for students wishing to complete both degrees at Illinois State University. The B.S. degree is awarded after completion of the undergraduate degree requirements and the M.P.A. degree is awarded after completion of the graduate degree requirements. The program is not designed to admit students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree.
Students must successfully apply for continuance in the B.S./M.P.A. program in their junior year. Graduate admission would take place after the student has completed approximately 90 hours. Students will be admitted who meet graduate entrance requirements, which include satisfactory performance on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), their previous academic performance, and other evidence of their ability to successfully complete the program. Admission timing is very important to successfully complete the program so students should regularly consult with their Accounting undergraduate or graduate advisor.
Courses completed in the Department of Accounting at this University with grades below C will not count toward the graduation requirements of the Integrated BS/MPA Major, but all grades of D, F, and WX in Accounting courses at this University will be included in computing the cumulative GPA.
Students in the integrated B.S./M.P.A Degrees program must complete one of the following sequences.
Accountancy and Information Systems Sequence

This AMD is designed for undergraduate teacher education students who, when they graduate with their undergraduate degree, will pursue employment as secondary English Language Arts (ELA) teachers. Qualifying students with a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher may apply to the AEES once they have reached junior status. Admission is based on competitiveness of the applicant. Application procedures are available on the English Education website and applications are considered on a rotating basis each fall and spring semester. Acceptance into the AEES constitutes acceptance into the MA/MS in English Education. To transfer to graduate-only status after completing the BA in English Education, students must submit an application to the Graduate School for the MA/MS in English Education.

Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the following minors: African Studies, African-American Studies, Children’s Studies, Civic Engagement and Responsibility, Cognitive Science, Ethnic Studies, European Studies, International Studies, Latin American and Latino/a Studies, Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies, Native American Studies, and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; and also the Minor in Religious Studies in the Department of Philosophy. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs and Department of Philosophy sections.
Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing. By providing a broad work experience, students not only build their portfolios, but also enter the marketplace with valuable and current skills.

FERPA
Notification of Rights Under FERPA for Postsecondary Institutions:
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include:
(1) The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access.
A student should submit to the University Registrar a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.
(2) The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA.
A student who wishes to ask the University to amend a record should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed.
If the University decides not to amend the record as requested, the University will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student’s right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.
(3)  The right to provide written consent before the University discloses personally identifiable information from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.
The University discloses education records without a student’s prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using University employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.
A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the University.
Upon request, the University also discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.
(4)  The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is:
Family Policy Compliance OfficeU.S. Department of Education400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC  20202-5901
(5) Illinois State University will, upon written request, disclose to the alleged victim of any crime of violence or a nonforcible sex offense, the results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by the institution against a student who is the alleged perpetrator of such crime or offense. If the alleged victim is deceased as a result of the crime or offense, the information shall be provided, upon request, to the next of kin of the alleged victim.
Public Notification of Directory Information
At its discretion, Illinois State University may provide “directory information” in accordance with the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). Directory information is defined as that information which would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Designated directory information at Illinois State University includes the following: student’s name*, address (local and home), Illinois State University email address, place and date of birth (month and day only), major field of study, dates of attendance, grade level, enrollment status (e.g. undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time), participation in officially recognized activities or sports, weight or height of members of athletic teams, target graduation date, degrees, honors and awards received, and the most recent educational agency or institution attended. Students may block the public disclosure of directory information by notifying the Office of the University Registrar in writing prior to the first day of classes.
Please consider very carefully the consequences of a decision to withhold directory information. A non-disclosure block will call for Illinois State University not to release any of this “directory information;” thus, any future requests for such information from non-institutional persons or organizations will be refused.
Illinois State University will honor your request to withhold directory information but cannot assume responsibility to contact you for subsequent permission to release this information. Regardless of the effect upon you, Illinois State University assumes no liability as a result of honoring your instructions that such information be withheld.
Although the initial request may be filed at any time, requests for non-disclosure will be honored by the University until removed, in writing, by the student.
*The name included on the student’s ISU application (the student’s legal name) is the name used for directory information purposes. If a student has also entered a preferred name in the Campus Solutions and/or HR system, that preferred name will be used ONLY for specific internal University operations and will not be used as directory information. To change your name for directory information purposes, you must change your legal name in the system. Information on how to do this is available at the University Registrar website or by contacting the Registrar directly at (309) 438-2188. If you are also an employee, information on how to change your legal name for employment purposes, is available on the Human Resources website or by contacting them directly at (309) 438-8311. Questions regarding use of a preferred name should also be directed to the above offices.

Major in Integrated Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Master of Professional Accountancy (M.P.A.)
The integrated B.S./M.P.A. Degrees program is primarily oriented toward preparation for professional careers in accounting. Two sequences are offered: (1) Accountancy and Information Systems, and (2) Professional Accountancy. Both sequences permit graduates of the B.S. and M.P.A. degrees to meet minimum education requirements to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination in Illinois.
The 150-hour B.S. (min. 120 hours) and M.P.A. (min. 30 hours of graduate level coursework) integrated program is designed for students wishing to complete both degrees at Illinois State University. The B.S. degree is awarded after completion of the undergraduate degree requirements and the M.P.A. degree is awarded after completion of the graduate degree requirements. The program is not designed to admit students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree.
Students must successfully apply for continuance in the B.S./M.P.A. program in their junior year. Graduate admission would take place after the student has completed approximately 90 hours. Students will be admitted who meet graduate entrance requirements, which include satisfactory performance on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), their previous academic performance, and other evidence of their ability to successfully complete the program. Admission timing is very important to successfully complete the program so students should regularly consult with their Accounting undergraduate or graduate advisor.
Courses completed in the Department of Accounting at this University with grades below C will not count toward the graduation requirements of the Integrated BS/MPA Major, but all grades of D, F, and WX in Accounting courses at this University will be included in computing the cumulative GPA.
Students in the integrated B.S./M.P.A Degrees program must complete one of the following sequences.
Accountancy and Information Systems Sequence

Effective fall of 2017, the University will also provide a report that includes information on campus sexual violence impacting the University community as required by the Illinois Preventing Sexual Violence in Higher Education Act. 
The Annual Security Report and Fire Safety is available on the Campus Safety and Security website at: Security.IllinoisState.edu. If you have any questions or would like to request a paper copy of the report, please contact the Illinois State University Police Department at (309) 438-8631.

Endorsement areas may impact General Education requirements. Consult your advisor. 
Middle Level Education majors must choose two content areas for endorsement. Passage of ILTS content exams may be requried beyond the coursework listed. Since ISBE subsequent endorsement requirements are subject to change due to updated licensure code, students must confirm current requirements with their academic advisor each year of enrollment to ensure required coursework and additional ISBE licensure requirements for each endorsement are completed at the time of graduation.

Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Students are required to take a core of two courses on African-American history and literature, as well as elective courses in the social sciences (History, Sociology, and Politics and Government) and in the humanities and fine arts (English, Music, and Theatre and Dance), and in interdisciplinary programs (including relevant course offerings in Interdisciplinary Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies).

Interested students should contact the Office of International Studies and Programs.
 Minor in Children's Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
The Minor in Children's Studies provides an opportunity for students to enhance their knowledge of children and child culture through interdisciplinary exploration of child-related issues.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies.

College of Education (COE)
College of Education Programs
The College of Education includes the Departments of Educational Administration and Foundations and Special Education, the School of Teaching and Learning, the Cecilia J. Lauby Teacher Education Center, and the Laboratory Schools (Thomas Metcalf School and University High School).
The mission of the College of Education is to purposefully allocate intellectual and financial resources to develop talented graduates and professionals, establish meaningful partnerships, foster innovative faculty and staff, advance academic excellence, and embrace the principles of Realizing the Democratic Ideal.
The preparation and continuing professional development of educators is the core of this mission. The guiding framework for teacher education at Illinois State University, “Realizing the Democratic Ideal,” captures the values of education programs: “To teach in a democracy is self-consciously to take up the burden of improving the ethical and intellectual quality of our societal dialogue by including in it as many educated voices as possible.” A comprehensive offering of degree, licensure, and outreach programs operated year round at both undergraduate and graduate levels constitutes the primary mechanism through which the mission is fulfilled.
The College also fulfills its strategic mission of influencing education by interacting directly with practitioners in the field in a variety of partnerships in schools and other associations and agencies. In addition, the College is an active participant in discussions related to educational policy development within national, state, and local arenas.

Class Attendance
The attendance regulation of the University is based on two principles. First, students are expected to attend class regularly; and second, students are primarily responsible to the instructor in matters pertaining to class attendance. Every student will be held responsible for class attendance and successful completion of academic work. Attendance regulations are intended to encourage student maturity and are based on the assumption that academic success is the student’s primary goal in college.

 - Any student in an institution of higher learning, other than a religious or denominational institution of higher learning, who is unable, because of his or her religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examination, study, or work requirement and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up the examination, study, or work requirement that he or she may have missed because of such absence on a particular day; provided that the student notifies the faculty member or instructor well in advance of any anticipated absence or a pending conflict between a scheduled class and the religious observance and provided that the make-up examination, study, or work does not create an unreasonable burden upon the institution. No fees of any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the student such an opportunity. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student because of his or her availing himself or herself of the provisions of this Section.  For more information please see the ISU Policy 1.6 Religious Accommodation Policy available at: 
https://policy.illinoisstate.edu/conduct/1-1-6.shtml
. 
Military Service - In accordance with state laws and regulations (330 ILCS 60/5.2), a service member enrolled in an institution of higher learning who is unable, because of his or her military service, to attend classes on a particular day or days has the right to be excused and to reschedule a course examination administered on such day or days. The faculty and administrative officials shall make available to the service member an opportunity to make up any examination he or she has missed because of his or her military service. 
Extended Student Absences - As a service to students, the Dean of Students Office can provide notification to instructors when students have been/will be absent from class(es) for three or more consecutive days and are unable to notify their instructors. Students are not required to report absences to the Dean of Students Office; the office serves as a resource to help students reach instructors. The student is responsible for providing verification of the absence to instructors, if requested. Only instructors have the authority to excuse students from class(es) or coursework. 
Student Leave of Absence Policy 2.1.5 - Students may request a leave of absence for up to six (6) consecutive terms (Fall, Spring, Summer).
Class Registration - Assistance with the class registration process may be obtained by contacting the Registrar Service Center at Registrar@IllinoisState.edu, (309) 438-2188, or in-person in Moulton Hall Room 107. Students at Illinois State University are responsible for following registration procedures to assure valid registration for classes.

Class Standing - Students in a bachelor’s degree program are classified as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A student must have completed 30 semester hours to be classified as a sophomore, 60 hours to be classified as a junior, and 90 hours to be classified as a senior. Students not working toward a degree at Illinois State are listed as non-degree-seeking students.
Code of Student Conduct - The Code of Student Conduct details the rules and regulations for students and student organizations.
Course Load (Academic Load)  - A full-time undergraduate student carries between 12 and 17 hours. Courses taken on an audit (AU) basis do not count toward full-time student status. For enrollment verification purposes, 12 hours is considered full-time for undergraduate students. A student wishing to carry more than 17 hours in a semester (12 hours in summer) may seek permission to do so their academic advisor. The granting of this permission will depend on the student’s scholastic record. A freshman may not carry over 17 hours during their first semester. A student considering enrolling in any classes, including extension or correspondence, at another college or university with concurrent registration at Illinois State University should consult with their advisor.
Course Information - Numbering, types, terms used in course descriptions 
Course Repetition(s) - If a student completes a course, or drops a course after the tenth day of classes receiving a grade of WX, the student may repeat that course once.  Students seeking a third enrollment must obtain permission from the academic advisor who will submit a Registration Clearance Permit request to the Registrar Service Center to allow the student to register in the course. When a course has been repeated at Illinois State University, the most recent grade (A, B, C, D, F) that the student earns will replace the previous grade in the cumulative GPA calculation. A grade of WX, AU, I, CR, CT, NC, P, NP will not replace the grade, nor the hours earned in the prior attempt. The previous grade(s) will not be removed from the student’s transcript, and the credit hours from only the last attempt can be used toward meeting minimum hourly requirements.When an articulated course has been repeated at another college or university, that grade will not replace the previous grade earned at ISU nor can it be used to improve the cumulative or major grade point average. However, the transfer credit may be used to satisfy a prerequisite, major, minor, or other requirement at Illinois State University.Students repeating a course to improve their GPA should be aware that many professional and graduate schools recalculate GPAs to include all courses attempted. Graduate students should be aware that this regulation does not apply to general courses (see Limitation of Credit for General Courses section in the Graduate Catalog). Courses that allow multiple enrollments have a separate grade recorded for each enrollment and each grade (A, B, C, D, or F) is counted toward the student's GPA. Previous grades are not replaced or removed from the student’s record until the maximum allowable enrollments or credit hours for the course has been exceeded.An Illinois State student considering repeating or enrolling in any classes, including extension or correspondence, at another college or university while enrolled at or pursuing a degree from Illinois State University should consult with their advisor.
Credit Hour Policy 4.1.19
Credit for Military Service 
Cross-listed Course - Cross-listed courses are offered by more than one department or school, but treated as one course for credit purposes. A cross-listed course will be considered as one course regardless of the department/school through which the student registered for the course. This is a general rule that applies to all cross-listed courses taken for any purpose.

If the seal is granted in a language not offered at Illinois State University, eight credit hours of lower division foreign language will be awarded. Students must request course credit for their seal within three academic years after graduating from high school. No credit will be awarded for the State Commendation toward Biliteracy, though students with the commendation are encouraged to determine their level through self-placement exams and/or proficiency exams (refer to the Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures (LAN) website). Students with the Seal of Biliteracy may also be eligible for higher levels of credit, which can be earned through taking a course (see self-placement exams) or a proficiency exam (refer to the LAN website).

A student may supply his or her own materials and request the instructor, in writing, to reduce the materials charge.
Payment of Tuition and Fees - Illinois State University offers payment plans for current semester charges. Students will choose what plan works best for their needs or must pay in full by the designated date listed on the Student Accounts website to avoid being enrolled in an administrative plan. Paying in full is the only way to avoid a payment plan fee.
Insurance Fee Reduction - A student may receive a reduction of the insurance fee if the student demonstrates equal or better insurance coverage and completes the application and provides proof of other coverage each semester prior to the 15th calendar on the day of the fall and spring semesters and the 8th calendar day of the summer semester. Visit Student Insurance website for specific information.
Reduction in Charges:
Pursuant to guidelines established by the University, part or all of a student’s tuition and fees may be reduced because of the student’s death or disability, extreme hardship, or institutional error.
A student may receive a reduction of all tuition and fees if the University declares him or her ineligible for enrolled status prior to the first day of regularly scheduled class.
Visit the Housing website for information regarding changes to or cancellation of housing contracts 
Visit the Campus Dining website for information regarding changes to or cancellation of a dining plan 
Students or parents who believe that individual circumstances warrant exceptions from published policy may appeal to the Associate Vice President for Student Affairs.
Resident and Non-Resident Status - An applicant or enrolled student is classified either as a resident of Illinois, a non-resident, or a foreign student. Residency for tuition purposes is different from residency for voting, taxing purposes, undergraduate degree academic residency, or residency requirements of on-campus doctoral programs. A student must be a U.S. citizen or have been approved for U.S. Permanent Resident status in order to be considered as an Illinois resident. An individual’s residency status is based on information from the admission application. A student who is not a resident of Illinois pays an out-of-state differential charge per credit hour. All other fees are the same for non-residents. A student under 18 years of age is considered a non-resident if the student’s parents are not legal residents of Illinois. A student over 18 years of age is considered a non-resident if the student is not a legal resident of Illinois. A student who begins as a non-resident may later qualify for resident status. Additionally, select students receive an alternate rate of tuition of 1.0 times the current in-state rate, including: students admitted from Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin; veterans and students utilizing VA education benefit, students who meet the eligibility requirements (as set for the specific fall term in question) for our principal scholarship programs, namely the Presidential, University, Redbird, Transfer Student Scholarship, or Phi Theta Kappa Scholarship; students who are identified by a unit (Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts, Forensics, Gamma Phi Circus) through their selective processes (audition, portfolio, etc.) based upon a specific talent. Guidelines for qualifying and special circumstances may be found on the University Registrar’s website. Personnel within the Office of the University Registrar are responsible for determining residency. 
Summer Session Tuition and Fees - The summer session tuition and fees are assessed at a per semester hour rate. Students enrolled for six or more semester hours will be charged the current rate for health insurance.
Withdrawal and Reduction of Tuition and Fees - If a student drops a course or withdraws from Illinois State University, charges for tuition, mandatory fees, and outreach fees will be adjusted based on the date of the course drop or withdrawal. A registered student who officially withdraws from the University may receive a reduction of tuition and fees according to the schedule on the Student Accounts website. The University may designate an abbreviated withdrawal policy for summer session, special courses, and short courses.All notifications of withdrawal from the University must be in person with photo ID to the Registrar Service Center, 107 Moulton Hall, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, or in writing and addressed to Office of the University Registrar, Illinois State University, Campus Box 2202, Normal, IL 61790-2202, faxed to (309) 438-8652, or emailed from the student’s Illinois State University email account to Registrar@IllinoisState.edu.
Undergraduate Teaching Assistantships (UTA) and Undergraduate Research Assistantships (URA)
Undergraduate Teaching Assistantships are available in nearly all departments of the University to juniors and seniors who have demonstrated excellence in a particular discipline and high overall  scholastic achievement.  The purpose of the program is to assist the faculty in the improvement of instruction and to provide UTAs with a valuable learning opportunity.
Undergraduate Research Assistantships (URA) are available in selected departments for students who have demonstrated excellence in a particular discipline with significant potential in research. The purpose of the program is to work closely with faculty members and to provide students valuable opportunities for research.
The responsibilities and nature of the UTA and URA assignments are determined by the departments and colleges. Some departments provide the opportunity for credit to be earned by the UTA under a General Offerings course (291 Seminar: Undergraduate Teaching Assistants). Three hours is the maximum amount of this credit that may be allowed for graduation. Tuition and fees are assessed in the usual manner for all credit earned in the UTA and URA experiences. Application forms are available in the departmental and college offices.

Notes
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in History. In addition to the HIS 497 required course, students may choose to take up to 9 hours of graduate level electives to count towards the 9 credit hours of additional senior college level History electives required for the undergraduate program. It is strongly recommended that one of these courses be HIS 496, another required course for the MA/MS degree. Refer to the Course Finder website for 400-level graduate courses and 300-level courses that are approved for graduate credit. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure graduate-level approval. For information on graduate-level history requirements, please visit the graduate academic catalog.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct.

    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

Languages, Literatures and Cultures
Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language. 
For information about admission to this program visit the University’s Academics website.

Leadership and Management
The Master of Science in Nursing is distributed among core, support, and nursing specialty courses. 34-44 semester hour program (depending on sequence chosen).
All students must successfully complete a synthesis project within the specified capstone course from each sequence. NUR 477 is the capstone course identified for the Family Nurse Practitioner sequence, NUR 483 is the capstone course identified for the Leadership and Management (NLM) sequence. Those students interested in research and doctoral study may choose to complete a thesis that would result in additional degree hours.
The master’s program is developed based on nationally recognized standards for graduate education in nursing. All courses applied toward the degree must be completed at the 400 level or above. In order to maintain clinical proficiency, students who have completed the final practicum course for their enrolled sequence but who do not meet the requirements for graduation must enroll in ongoing practicum independent study (NUR 400) until graduation. A contract outlining the specific requirements for the Independent Study will be developed between the Director of Graduate Programs and the student.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct. The University also reserves the rights to establish additional requirements with respect to specific University venues.
In general, the University will not interfere with events, meetings, assemblies, rallies, demonstrations, vigils, or protests in public areas of University facilities and spaces unless participants engage in one or more of the following behaviors:
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent (a) the orderly conduct of a function or activity, including, but not limited to, classes and other instructional activities; research; study; lectures; presentations; performances; meetings; interviews; administrative business; ceremonies; or other public events; or (b) access to any room or space in which such functions or activities are being held.

Continue to engage in behaviors prohibited in this section after a University official or University Police has declared that the conduct violates University policies or an applicable law and has instructed the participants to modify or
    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

Choosing a Major
Choosing a Major
Choosing a major may be one of the easiest decisions you have ever made or it may be an overwhelming and stressful decision.
At Illinois State University, we utilize numerous resources to help you choose a major(s). University College Academic Advising is available to any student who is undeclared/undecided or who plans to change majors.
A couple quick things to keep in mind when comparing major requirements. The middle 50 percent GPA gives the range of students typically admitted into the major. Twenty five percent of students admitted have a lower GPA, so you should not view the lower GPA as a minimum required for acceptance. Also the sample plans of study provided are based on the current Undergraduate Catalog.

Learn About Yourself
The key to finding a satisfying career is matching your personality to your career choice. Understanding who you are, your likes and dislikes, is the first step. This is a process that takes some time and reflection. But your career will occupy the majority of your adult life, so it’s worth taking some time to learn what will be satisfying to you to help you make good career decisions.
People like careers for many different reasons...
Interests: Enjoying classes in this area, talking about the subject, or spending time doing related tasks.
Personal Values: Feeling energized and excited to think about making a contribution in this area, finding the career personally meaningful.
Opportunity to Use Talents: Seeing your unique talents and skills are maximized in a career. For example, you may have special talent as a writer, educator, person who empathizes with others, or leader. Careers that give you an opportunity to use those gifts will be appealing.
The more you know about a career, the better able you are to decide if you would like it. Career assessment may help you identify your interests, values and skills.
Are You Undecided or Indecisive?
It's helpful to consider whether you are undecided or indecisive. Being undecided is a normal step along the way. It usually means you need more information about yourself, educational options, careers, or perhaps how college majors relate to career options.
Being indecisive is different. It may indicate you have trouble making decisions in many areas or struggle to make a decision in spite of having information. There are many reasons you might be indecisive. Fear of making a mistake is one common reason.
You might find it helpful to speak to a counselor at Student Counseling Services if you think that being indecisive is a problem you face.
Signs You May Be Undecided
You need more information about careers
You need more information about your personality
You generally make good decisions in other areas
You are unsure what criteria to base your decision on
Recommendations
Enroll in IDS 106 - Career Choice
Enroll in IDS 128 - Thriving in College, Career and Beyond
FOCUS the online, self-guided career and education planning tool designed to help select major programs and career fields most compatible with personal interests, skills, and goals.
Meet with Academic Advisor
Consult with Career Services or Student Counseling Services
Signs You May Be Indecisive
Struggle to make decisions in many areas of life
Feel fearful of making a mistake
Postpone decisions hoping others will decide for me
Change my mind frequently
Get very anxious about making a decision
Feel unready to face the consequences of my decision
Worry about what others think of my decisions
Feel very uncertain despite having information needed to make a decision
Worry my decision will be the wrong one
Feel I never have enough information to make a good decision
Recommendations
Counseling at Student Counseling Services to address any personal issues relating to your career decision making
Selecting a major and selecting a career are different!
An employer will consider your major as just one of many factors when making a hiring decision. In addition to your major, the skills you've acquired, your personal attributes and achievements will all factor into the hiring decision. Some majors lead to a wide variety of career paths. Thus it is important to have a well rounded college experience.
Keep in mind that some careers require a specialized degree and/or certification. These areas include: teaching, nursing, geology, and speech pathology.
Many people vary their careers during their lifetime. Thus, selecting your major does not have to be a one-time decision. You may be surprised where your career takes you.
By Major
Do you have an idea of the academic areas you are interested in? If so...
Make a list of all of the major options which may be a good fit for you
Learn more about the majors and careers in your identified areas of interest
Complete some of the activities listed above which will assist you in narrowing your major options so you are ready to make your decision
By Career
When selecting your major, it is important to consider future career options. Things to consider include the following:
The difference between selecting a major and choosing your career
Various career options and the major options that can get you there
Skills that can get you to your intended career
How do I know what the job outlook for a career will be?
The Occupational Outlook Handbook is an excellent resource you can use to find out information about careers as they exist in the "real world." Click on the A-Z Index and enter an occupation that interests you. You will be provided with information such as the job outlook, earnings, nature of the work, working conditions, training and other qualifications, and advancement.
Another helpful resource for career exploration is the O*NET Online Occupational Information Network developed for the U.S. Department of Labor. This extensive online database allows for a variety of detailed occupational searches based on categories, skills, interests and much more. A number of other useful online career information resources are also linked to the O*NET Online system.
Transferable Skills
Frequently, students do not consider participation in student organizations, class projects, and volunteer work to be significant activities to put on to a resume. Then, when they begin writing their resume, they feel like they do not have experiences to write about. Quite the opposite is true!
This activity helps students identify the transferable skills they developed during college and prepares them to choose an academic major, intentionally select involvement opportunities, write a resume, and find interesting career options.
What is a transferable skill?
A transferable skill is a skill or ability acquired during any activity in life – jobs, classes, projects, hobbies, sports, internships, volunteer work, virtually anything – that can be utilized in a different setting or while participating in a different activity. The transferable skills developed throughout a college career can be evaluated to help determine what type of major, involvement activities, and even careers you may be best suited for. Employers are most interested in candidates who can build on skills developed and refined in college and transfer those skills to the “working world”.
Why are transferable skills important to identify?
Identifying specific skill sets each student possesses will help when navigating life choices ranging from academic major selection to job application. College graduates do not always have practical experience or technical skill abilities for the field to which they are applying. As you recognize skills you have gained throughout college that are similar to those used in a chosen field or industry, you will become more confident in your abilities.
Hints in identifying your own transferable skills
Transferable skills can be developed while doing almost anything! Here are some examples of ways transferable skills can be developed:
jobs and work experiences
volunteer opportunities
classes: major and non-major courses
groups you have been a part of and the leadership opportunities you have utilized
innate abilities or skills others always comment to you about such as compassion, organization, thoughtfulness, originality
Applying to a Major
Depending on where you are as a student, your process for applying to a major may be a bit different. Keep in mind, each major at Illinois State has its own unique application procedures.
Prospective Students
If you are not currently an Illinois State student and want to be, you'll have the opportunity to choose your major when you apply to the University through the Office of Admissions
Admitted Students
Students admitted to Illinois State who have not yet begun classes must contact the Office of Admissions to change your major. Please be aware, different major programs may have different admission criteria.
Current Students
Once classes begin, you will be able to apply to change your major through My.IllinoisState. Once you're logged in, click on the "Academics" tab, then on the "Apply to My Program" link.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts.

We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies.

Languages, Literatures and Cultures
Admission/Retention Requirements
Language Placement Information
For those languages which have no specific placement recommendations listed in this Undergraduate Catalog, students who have had no prior instruction in a world language, or one year of instruction, should enroll in the LAN 111 course for the appropriate language. Students who have had 2, 3, or 4 years generally enroll in LAN 112 or LAN 115. If prior language study took place more than one year earlier, a student may choose to enroll at a lower level. Transfer students and native speakers should consult with the Department’s academic advisor to determine proper placement. The best way to assure that a student begins at the right Illinois State University level is to use the above as a reference and then to take the online self-placement test.
Credit for Acquired Proficiency (CAP)
If the first Languages, Literatures, and Cultures course in which a student enrolls is above LAN 111 in the regular sequence (LAN 112, LAN 115, LAN 116 or above), he or she may be eligible for proficiency acquired elsewhere. Student must apply for CAP by filling out a short form in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures.
Credit toward graduation for acquired proficiency will be granted upon completion at Illinois State University of one course (excluding Independent Study) with the grade of C or better. It is recommended that the course be taken as soon as possible after matriculation at Illinois State University. Students are reminded that no course in the major or minor may be taken under the P/NP (Passing/No Passing) option.
Students beginning at the LAN 112-level and fulfilling the previous requirements will be granted 4 hours of CAP. Students beginning at the LAN 115-level or above and fulfilling the above requirements will be granted 8 hours of CAP.
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures also accepts credit for the Seal of Biliteracy, International Baccalaureate, and AP exams. For more information, visit the Academic Practices and Policies section of the catalog. 
Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures participates in the Major in European Studies and the minors in Cognitive Science; Ethnic Studies; European Studies, International Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information, please consult the program advisors as well as the Interdisciplinary Studies Programs page.
Language of Instruction in Courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures
Because the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures promotes the acquisition of world languages, the official language of instruction and class discussion will be the language of study in the majority of cases. Courses in pedagogy are frequently taught in English. LAN prefixed coures (taught in English) that contribute to Gen Ed: LH and H can complement a major or a minor in a language.

Honors in History
Honors work in the Department of History has been designed to offer to qualified undergraduates the opportunity to develop an independent, individualized program of study while working closely with departmental faculty in the field of their special interest. Students who complete the requirements will graduate with Departmental Honors, which will be noted on their transcript and diploma.
Honors Admissions Requirements
To be admitted to the Honors Program, stu­dents must: (1) be members of the University Honors Program, and (2) have completed 45 hours, at least nine hours in history with a minimum GPA of 3.50 in History. Recom­mendation of at least one member of the departmental faculty is required as is the approval of the Departmental Honors Advi­sor. Students may also be invited to apply by a faculty member. In specific cases these requirements may be waived but only with the express approval of the Departmental Honors Advisor and the History Department Chairperson.
Honors Study Requirements
In order to graduate with distinction as a Departmental Honors Scholar in the Department of History, the student must complete (1) at least 6 hours of Honors work in the major - HON/HIS 299, HIS 301 (which require pre-approval from the Departmental Honors Advisor), (2) all university graduation requirements, (3) all regular requirements for the major, and (4) all University Honors requirements as outlined in the catalog. The Departmental Honors Advisor and the History Department Chairperson will regularly evaluate students in the program. Any student whose work does not meet the minimal standards of the program will not be allowed to continue.
For more information on Honors in History, including admission and retention standards, please visit the Honors website.

Interdisciplinary Minors
The Department of History participates in a number of interdisciplinary minors and one interdisciplinary major at the University. Coursework offered by the Department contributes to the Major in European Studies and the following minors: African-American Studies; African Studies; Classical Studies; European Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies; Native American Studies; Urban Studies; and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. For further information on these minors and their advisors, please consult the Interdisciplinary Studies Program section.
Major in History
Admission to the History major, including the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, may be restricted by the lack of available Department resources.
The Department of History encourages stu­dents seeking a bachelor’s degree to develop both global and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of history and to apply these methods to their studies in other disciplines. To develop their skills in historical analysis and to learn to think critically about histori­cal accounts, students complete HIS 100, HIS 200, and HIS 300. To acquire both a well-rounded and a global understanding of historical processes, students are required to take 6 hours each in the 3 fields of European, non-Western, and United States History.
The Department of History recognizes the value of language to the study of history from a global perspective. For this reason, the department recommends that all students majoring in history complete a Bachelor of Arts program. Those students majoring in history but choosing to pursue a Bachelor of Sciences program must complete a minor program.
Students in the History major must complete one of the following sequences.
General History Sequence
B.A. students are encouraged to improve their career opportunities by minoring in another discipline. B.A. students not opting for a minor must choose an area of concentration by taking a minimum of 9 hours in any field other than history or foreign language; at least 3 of these hours must be in 200- or 300-level courses. B.A. students are encouraged to continue their language studies beyond the 12 hours required by the Bachelor of Arts.
B.A. and B.S. students in either the History (non-teaching) or History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence must complete HIS 100 during their freshman year as History majors and should complete HIS 200 before enrolling in any 300-level History course. HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen. Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor. HIS 300 is a capstone course to be taken in the student’s last full semester on campus. For students in the History-Social Sciences Teacher Education Sequence, this would be the semester just prior to student teaching.
6 hours of non-Western History listed in group 3 of “History Courses by Group for the Major.” At least one of the non-Western electives must be at the senior level.
HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen, Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor.
B.A. students are encouraged to complete a minor; but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than history or foreign language, with at least 3 hours at the 200-or 300-level.
B.S. students must also complete a minor.
View General History Sequence Course Requirements
General History Accelerated Sequence
High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate programs in History. Students can then apply to the History graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the History graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the History Department advisor.
6 hours of non-Western History listed in group 3 of “History Courses by Group for the Major.” At least one of the non-Western electives must be at the senior level.
HIS 100 is limited to First-Semester Freshmen, Transfer students from outside ISU or from a different major at ISU will need to see the advisor.
B.A. students are encouraged to complete a minor; but, if a minor is not selected, they must complete a 9-hour concentration in any field other than history or foreign language, with at least 3 hours at the 200-or 300-level.
B.S. students must also complete a minor.

Civic Engagement and Responsibility
Overview
Illinois State’s core values are at the heart of the civic engagement and responsibility minor. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world.
The minor includes an internship class: IDS 398.02a:Community-Engaged Internship. For more information about how to apply for the internship, please refer to the 
internship application packet. The internship course is a culmination of the minor as the student engages in some aspect of service learning in the community. Contact Wendi Whitman to learn about the internship opportunity and to learn how to apply for the minor.
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.

Point of Pride
The Center for Civic Engagement supports our core value of civic engagement through programs, resources, and administrative support for campus initiatives like the American Democracy Project and the Civic Engagement and Responsibility minor.
We are the first and longest standing formal academic minor in the state of Illinois focused on civic engagement. Our Minor is interdisciplinary and our graduates and current students have majors in five of the six colleges.
Why study Civic Engagement and Responsibility?
The Civic Engagement and Responsibility minor prepares you to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in your communities. This interdisciplinary minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden your learning experience and career perspectives. The minor gives you opportunities to sharpen your analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action.

Facility and Space Use
Procedure
University Use of Facilities & Public Spaces Procedure
Illinois State University buildings and grounds are intended for use by students, faculty, and staff in support of the University's mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Individuals, groups, or organizations may use University buildings and grounds in accordance with University procedures, policies, rules, and regulations.
The following procedures apply to scheduling and use of facilities, conduct of events/activities, and unscheduled expressive events and activities in all areas controlled and/or scheduled by the University. This applies to all buildings, facilities, grounds, and other indoor/outdoor spaces owned, leased, maintained, or controlled by Illinois State University (collectively referred to as "facilities and grounds"). These procedures apply to all individuals, including all Illinois State University employees, students, University affiliates, registered student organizations, contractors, and visitors.
Procedures
The following information assists with ensuring compliance with all applicable Illinois State University policies and procedures and seeks to ensure that individual and group rights of expression, assembly, dissent, and protest are not infringed or abridged. In addition, this procedure seeks to support and preserve the means to maintain the safety of all members of the University community and visitors to the campus and to enable the University to fulfill its mission of teaching, scholarship, and service. Finally, it provides all members and visitors of the University community with the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. The following procedures outlined below provide content-neutral, minimally necessary standards to achieve these goals.

1. Unscheduled Expressive Events and Activities
Individuals may engage in unscheduled expressive events and activities in outdoor areas of the campus controlled or scheduled by University departments with the exceptions noted below.
The University is committed to protecting the rights of expression, assembly, protest, and dissent and to making its facilities and grounds available for these activities. Protecting impromptu and spontaneous assembly for the purpose of expression, protest, and dissent is essential to fulfilling this commitment. Thus, the lack of a reservation to use space is not a basis for terminating any expressive activity, including impromptu activities, unless the protest or assembly does the following:
It conflicts with a previously scheduled event in the same location.
It is being held in a restricted location (e.g. a laboratory or other area where activities may create safety or health risks).
It is identified as engaging in one or more of the prohibited behaviors described below in Section 4.
When an unscheduled activity conflicts with an event which was previously scheduled for the same time and space, the unscheduled activity shall be allowed to continue in its existing location until it needs to be relocated to allow for the prior scheduled activity or preparations for it. When those engaging in an unscheduled activity are required to relocate, they may request the appropriate University official to assist in relocating to a space where the activity can continue or in scheduling it for a different time.
To ensure space is available for an activity, individuals and organizations are encouraged to schedule space in non-restricted areas as indicated below.
2. Scheduling and Using University Facilities
a. Reserving Facilities
To schedule or reserve University Facilities please use the appropriate reservation process for each area listed at https://illinoisstate.edu/about/facility-space-use/reservation. 
b. Cost Incurred
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for any cost incurred on the part of the University, including clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, and extra security as deemed necessary unless such costs are specifically waived by the University.
In the event an activity is causing damage or destruction of property or imminently threatening to cause such damage or destruction, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event or activity be relocated to an alternative space at the University. If this is not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event be rescheduled. If this is also not possible, a University official or Illinois State University Police may ask that the event cease and desist.
3. Administration and Procedural Application
a. Reviewing and Prioritizing Requests
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the Event Planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (i.e. security staff, EMS personnel, other security, insurance requirements and related loss prevention measures). Several factors will be considered for the proposed event or activity, included but not limited to:
anticipated size, crowd density, crowd control, public or private, tickets or general admission
noise likely to be generated and impact, if any, on academic activities or other University activities in the vicinity
impact on traffic and parking
adequacy and suitability requested to the location
event history, hours, performer history, first-time event
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies
potential risk to the health or safety of participants, observers, or others
presence of minors, alcohol, animals, cash, media, or pyrotechnics
any other similar, content-neutral factors that are related to any standard in this section
Subject to the priorities outlined in this procedure, reservations for facilities and grounds are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the Event Planner will work with the sponsors or organizers of the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances. If special precautions or arrangements may be necessary, the event will be reviewed by the University Event Review Committee. This committee generally consists of representatives from:
Illinois State University Police
Emergency Management
Environmental Health and Safety
Office of General Counsel
Risk Management
Additional departments as the need arises
b. Event Staffing
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. When assessing an event, those reserving the space, those involved in planning the event, and/or those hosting the event must evaluate the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
It is through this process of planning, organizing, leading, and assessing activities that the individual, organization, and University minimize adverse effects of accident or loss and protect their interests and assets.
The University event planner/scheduler will determine if the event requires review by the University Event Review Committee. The University Event Review Committee will review the event details, assess the event and determine what measures or requirements are necessary. The University Event Review Committee must grant approval to all events referred for its review before a reservation is finalized/confirmed. 
The individual or organization sponsoring the event shall be responsible for all costs incurred but not limited to clean-up, special construction, set-up costs, security, EMT, insurance, and facility operations as the University deems necessary.
The following offices make recommendations to the University Event Review Committee:
University Police recommends necessary security staffing levels at all events. 
Environmental Health and Safety recommends necessary Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) staffing levels at all events.
Emergency Management recommends an Incident Action Plan if necessary. 
Risk Management recommends required insurance and/or other loss prevention/risk management measures.
Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality recommends any additional operational needs or measures necessary.
University Police Department, Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Event Management, Dining, and Hospitality may adjust their staffing levels as necessary based on changing conditions/needs.
c. Reasons for Delaying/Denying Reservation Requests
Some typical reasons for delaying/denying a reservation request may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
The applicant has not completed the appropriate reservation process for the desired location.
The request to reserve space contains a misrepresentation or false information.
The request is not received sufficiently in advance of the proposed event or activity to permit necessary evaluation and to determine the appropriate location.
The use of the space or activity intended by the request is prohibited by law or proposes behaviors or conduct proscribed as prohibited in Illinois State University Policies.
The applicant has a past due balance for non- payment or for failure to pay for past damage that is more than 90 days overdue from the date of invoice.
The applicant is not in good booking status for scheduling events with the University and has been provided previous notice of this revoked status. 
The use of activity would present an unreasonable health or safety risk.
The applicant does not have the appropriate level of insurance, the type of insurance required to host the event, or cannot provide for loss prevention measures requested.
The institution does not have the staffing capacity for the date and time requested. If this occurs, an event planner will work to find alternative dates.
The request to use University facilities or grounds conflicts with a preexisting reservation, and no reasonable alternative time or place is available. 
The facility / space requested is not suitable / appropriate for the planned use / event and no alternative suitable space is available.
Any individual or organization whose request is denied may appeal the denial to the appropriate Vice President(s) or their designee.
d. Documentation and Records Retention
Any department responsible for processing reservation requests is required to keep records of requests and actions taken, including reasons for denial, for five (5) years.
4. Prohibited Behaviors
This section establishes the generally prohibited behaviors that apply to use of University facilities and spaces controlled or scheduled by the University. These requirements supplement existing University policies that establish safety requirements or standards of behavior for members of the University community, including but not limited to the Code of Student Conduct. The University also reserves the rights to establish additional requirements with respect to specific University venues.
In general, the University will not interfere with events, meetings, assemblies, rallies, demonstrations, vigils, or protests in public areas of University facilities and spaces unless participants engage in one or more of the following behaviors:
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent (a) the orderly conduct of a function or activity, including, but not limited to, classes and other instructional activities; research; study; lectures; presentations; performances; meetings; interviews; administrative business; ceremonies; or other public events; or (b) access to any room or space in which such functions or activities are being held. 
Disrupt, interfere with, or prevent access to particular spaces where educational, health, or financial records are stored or located. 
Hold assemblies, demonstrations, protests, rallies, or vigils in:
Private offices or in private meetings.
Laboratories and associated facilities;
Computer centers;
Milner Library;
Indoor areas designed for study and designated as quiet spaces or facilities that normally contain valuable or sensitive materials, collections, or records protected by law or by an existing university procedure/policy;
Health care clinics, and other health care facilities;
Communication systems facilities, utility facilities, or other facilities conducting services vital to the continued functioning of the University.
Rooms in reasonable proximity to any of the above University facilities and spaces that would cause a noise disruption or otherwise interfere with University operations.
Injure persons, damage or destroy property, or threaten to cause such injury or damage.
Create safety hazards or jeopardize the safety and security of participants or others.
Occupy without authorization a building when it is normally closed or when individuals are not otherwise authorized to be there.
Construct structures on University grounds without prior written authorization from the Director of Facilities Management (or designee).
Violate an applicable federal or state law, local government ordinance, or University policy or procedure.
Continue to engage in behaviors prohibited in this section after a University official or University Police has declared that the conduct violates University policies or an applicable law and has instructed the participants to modify or
    terminate their behavior. 
In carrying out their duties and responsibilities under this rule, University officials and University Police shall take appropriate steps to identify themselves and the capacity in which they are acting before giving directions or instructions to others. 
The University may respond to disruptions pursuant to Policy 5.1.12 Proper Operation Of University In Case Of Disruptive Activity should it become necessary based on individual circumstances.
5. Outside Speakers and Groups
An individual or organization associate with the University that invites or sponsors non-University speakers, performers, or groups to conduct activities or events on campus should take active responsibility for the event by being visible, proactive, and accessible. The organization will assist with the overall "hosting" of the event, as well as the clearing of the room and building. 
The outside speaker, performer, or group may be given permission to use specific facilities through a written contract under terms and conditions that protect the University's institutional interests. Such groups may not state or imply University sponsorship of the organization or its program without written authorization.

Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) Program (Transferrable General Education Package) 
Illinois Articulation Initiative Program
Transferring General Education Courses
The Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) is a statewide transfer agreement among more than 100 public and private four-year and two-year higher education institutions in Illinois. The agreement is designed to facilitate students transferring between colleges and universities and works best for students who are undecided on the transfer-to institution that will grant their baccalaureate degree. The IAI General Education Core Curriculum (GECC) package consists of 12 to 13 courses (37 to 41 hours of credit) within a five-category designation. All schools participating in IAI agree to accept a completed IAI GECC package in lieu of their own comparable lower-division general education requirements. 
The 
IAI GECC package requirements 
are as follows:
Communication: 3 courses (9 credits)
Humanities and Fine Arts: 3 courses (9 credits)
Mathematics: 1 to 2 courses (3 to 6 credits)
Physical and Life Sciences: 2 courses (7 to 8 credits)
Social and Behavioral Sciences: 3 courses (9 credits)
IAI policy is presented on the IAI website, and Illinois State University’s implementation requirements are below. Students who transfer out of Illinois State will be held to the requirements of their transfer institution.
General Education Options for Transferring Students
New transfer students have the option of completing either Illinois State’s General Education program or the Illinois Articulation Initiative General Education Core Curriculum (IAI GECC) package.
To be eligible for IAI, at least one transfer course must have been articulated to an IAI General Education Core Curriculum requirement. Transfer students who have satisfactorily completed at least one course within the IAI GECC are allowed to complete this program by enrolling in approved IAI courses at Illinois State University. Students should note, however, that IAI course availability may be limited.
The Illinois Articulation Initiative provides recommendations to participating IAI schools about Advanced Placement Credit. However, each school has the final decision about how to award/give credit for Advance Placement Exams.
CLEP - Illinois State University policies on CLEP credit will be used to meet IAI General Education Core Curriculum requirements.
Waivers in the 
Illinois Articulation Initiative General Education Core Curriculum 
If a student satisfactorily completes the objectives of a General Education Core area but earns fewer hours than required, the remaining hours for that area can be waived. However, students must complete the minimum of 12 courses, 37 hours, and the number of courses required in each area of the Core. Fractional hours can also be waived, but the minimum 37 hour total is still enforced.
For those students eligible to complete the Core, a transfer course articulated as an Illinois State University course approved for the IAI General Education Core Curriculum package will be applied toward the Core. Any course from a participating school approved by an IAI curriculum panel may be applied even if not articulated to an Illinois State course. Acceptance and placement of transfer credit as an elective from a non-participating IAI institution is only applicable to meet IAI GECC package requirements at Illinois State University. Students should consult their academic advisor regarding the application for waivers.
Effective May 1999, a student transferring to another institution, who has completed at least 37 semester hours, may request an audit, via a transcript request, of his or her records for completion of the IAI General Education Core Curriculum package. 
Students transferring to Illinois State are required to fulfill all University graduation requirements.
Illinois Articulation Initiative Course Requirements
Regardless of category placement, a student may count no more than two courses from a single discipline to fulfill the General Education Core Curriculum requirements. Only one course assigned to an IAI course number may be used to fulfill a requirement (For example, since HIS 104A01 and HIS 104A03 both carry the IAI number of H2 903N, only one may be used). 
Illinois State University courses approved for the IAI General Education Core Curriculum package are listed officially on the IAI website. The following list of courses is provided for convenience only. Some courses may have been added or deleted since the publication of this catalog.
D: Designates IAI courses designed specifically to examine aspects of human diversity within the United States. 
N: Designates IAI courses designed specifically to examine aspects of human diversity from a non-U.S./non-European perspective. These courses satisfy the AMALI graduation requirement at Illinois State University.  
*Western Civilization (H2 901 or S2 902 and H2 902 or S2 903) and American/U.S. History (H2 904 or S2 900 or S2 901) can be used in the IAI category approved by the college or university offering the course or in the category in which the articulated course equivalent was approved at the receiving institution.
12 to 13 courses (37 to 41 hours of credit) 
Communication (3 courses, 9 hours) 
A grade of C or better required in C1 900, ENG 101, and C1 901R, ENG 145. For students with appropriate preparation, Illinois State will waive C1 900. A minimum of 12 courses and 37 semester hours is still required.

Professional Accountancy
Major in Integrated Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Master of Professional Accountancy (M.P.A.)
The integrated B.S./M.P.A. Degrees program is primarily oriented toward preparation for professional careers in accounting. Two sequences are offered: (1) Accountancy and Information Systems, and (2) Professional Accountancy. Both sequences permit graduates of the B.S. and M.P.A. degrees to meet minimum education requirements to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Examination in Illinois.
The 150-hour B.S. (min. 120 hours) and M.P.A. (min. 30 hours of graduate level coursework) integrated program is designed for students wishing to complete both degrees at Illinois State University. The B.S. degree is awarded after completion of the undergraduate degree requirements and the M.P.A. degree is awarded after completion of the graduate degree requirements. The program is not designed to admit students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree.
Students must successfully apply for continuance in the B.S./M.P.A. program in their junior year. Graduate admission would take place after the student has completed approximately 90 hours. Students will be admitted who meet graduate entrance requirements, which include satisfactory performance on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), their previous academic performance, and other evidence of their ability to successfully complete the program. Admission timing is very important to successfully complete the program so students should regularly consult with their Accounting undergraduate or graduate advisor.
Courses completed in the Department of Accounting at this University with grades below C will not count toward the graduation requirements of the Integrated BS/MPA Major, but all grades of D, F, and WX in Accounting courses at this University will be included in computing the cumulative GPA.
Students in the integrated B.S./M.P.A Degrees program must complete one of the following sequences.
Accountancy and Information Systems Sequence
The Accountancy and Information Systems sequence permits students to emphasize study of information systems related to accounting and other business fields.
View Accountancy and Information Systems Sequence Course Requirements

Using the Catalog
Using the Undergraduate Catalog
The statements in this catalog are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as the basis of a contract between a student and Illinois State University. The course offerings and requirements of the University are continually under review and revision. Information regarding courses may be found on the Course Finder website or by contacting the academic unit. It is especially important that each student note that it is his or her responsibility to be aware of current graduation requirements for a particular degree program.
Undergraduate Catalog Requirements
All students are assigned the Undergraduate Catalog year associated with their term of admission to Illinois State University. If attendance is not continuous, the student does not attend at least one term of each academic year, a student must meet the requirements specified in the Undergraduate Catalog in effect when he or she reenters the University. If such a student continues in the curriculum chosen originally, the hours earned in meeting the requirements of the original program may typically apply to the hour requirement of a revised program. In some rapidly advancing fields, students may be required to repeat courses where content has changed significantly. 
In all instances, the University may adjust graduation requirements to ensure that each graduate of a teacher preparation curriculum meets the course requirements for an Illinois Teaching License.
Advisors may request that a student be placed into an earlier catalog, up to two years prior to the assigned catalog, if it is in the student’s best interest. University programs are constantly evaluated and improved, a student may graduate under new requirements published while he or she is in attendance at the University. If a student changes catalog year, the student must meet all the requirements, including General Education and graduation requirements, in that catalog.
A catalog year begins the first day of summer session and ends the last day of the spring semester. 
Students are encouraged to review the following sections of this catalog:

Subject area codes ("PHI" for example is used to indicate courses in philosophy)

Food and Beverage Management Accelerated
Major in Food, Nutrition and Dietetics
The Food, Nutrition and Dietetics (FND) program at Illinois State University offers four sequences: Dietetics Sequence, Dietetics Accelerated Sequence, Food and Beverage Management Sequence, and Food and Beverage Management Accelerated Sequence.
Students in the Food, Nutrition and Dietetics major must complete one of the following sequences.
Dietetics Sequence
The Dietetics sequence is a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The DPD program is an integrative program that prepares graduates for careers that influence the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities through the knowledge of food and nutrition. The program prepares students for supervised practice leading to the eligibility for the CDR credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist. This sequence provides the first step for students wanting to become a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). To become an RDN, students must apply for an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after graduation, and, upon completion, are eligible to take the registration examination. Beginning January 1, 2024, a minimum of a master’s degree will be required for eligibility to take the registration examination for dietitians. An ACEND Verification Statement of DPD Completion will be given to students completing this sequence meeting program requirements. This official statement is required for graduates to begin an ACEND-accredited dietetic internship after acceptance, and for other professional applications requiring verification of DPD completion. The DPD program at Illinois State University is currently accredited by the ACEND of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ACEND is recognized by the United States Department of Education and can be contacted at 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 800-877-1600, Ext 5400.
View Dietetics Sequence Course Requirements
Dietetics Accelerated Sequence
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in Dietetics/Family and Consumer Sciences. Students can then apply to the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors. All accreditation information for the Dietetics Sequence applies to the Dietetics Accelerated Sequence. Students in the Dietetic Accelerated Sequence are encouraged to apply to ISU’s Track Two Dietetic Internship during the Spring Match in their senior year. The Dietetic Internship would take place following the senior year and be incorporated into the master’s degree.
Program Admission Requirements for New and Continuing Students: High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree.

Food and Beverage Management Sequence
The Food and Beverage Management sequence prepares graduates for careers in the growing food industry by combining business and management principles with food service and hospitality skills. This sequence requires fewer science courses (no organic and biochemistry) and more business and food-related courses than the dietetics sequence. Consumers spend about 50 percent of their food dollars in restaurants, cafeterias, fast-food franchises, at work, or at school. Food systems managers organize these operations and make sure the foods are attractive, nutritious, and safely prepared. This sequence meets the requirements to become eligible to take the Certified Dietary Manager Credentialing Exam. Popular career options include restaurant manager, cafeteria manager, caterer, and corporate, hospital, long-term care, or school food service manager. Employment opportunities also exist with companies that produce food, food ingredients, or processing equipment, and food safety inspection, food sales, marketing, and business management.

Major in Interior Design
The Interior Design (ID) program at Illinois State University offers two sequences: Interior Design Sequence, and Interior Design Accelerated Sequence, which is a pathway to the Family and Consumer Sciences graduate program.
Interior Design Sequence
The Interior Design program prepares students to design innovative, functional, supportive, and responsible interior environments that positively impact the quality of life within a global market. The curriculum develops students’ skills and knowledge in design, sketching and technical drawing, space planning, interior construction and building systems, materials specifications, historical interiors, building codes and accessibility guidelines. Sustainability issues and universal design are emphasized. The program is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA) and focuses on the broad range of specialties within commercial interior design. Course content is based on the knowledge and skills needed to pass the National Council for Interior Design Qualification certification exam. To be licensed in the State of Illinois, graduates of a 4-year CIDA-accredited program must have a minimum of two years professional work experience and pass the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) Examination. Passage of this exam also qualifies the individual for professional membership in interior design organizations such as International Interior Design Association (IIDA) and American Society of Interior Designers (ASID).

Notes
A maximum 6 hours of POL 398a01, IDS 398a02 and LGS 398a20 may count toward major.
Accelerated master 's degree (AMD) programs offer high achieving students the opportunity to complete their bachelor 's degree and master 's degree in a faster time frame than each degree separately. Students will take both graduate and undergraduate classes when they have junior or senior status and seamlessly transition into their master 's degree program. Students admitted into an accelerated master 's degree program may count a maximum of twelve (12) hours or 33% of course work (whichever is higher) towards both the bachelor 's degree and master 's degree. The coursework requires approval of the academic advisor.
Students must complete at least one graduate course as an undergraduate to be considered in the accelerated master’s degree program. If the student does not complete at least one graduate course, or chooses to withdraw from the accelerated program, they will be placed back in their original degree program.

Major in Legal Studies
The Legal Studies curriculum is an American Bar Association approved paralegal educational program. It is designed to prepare students for a career as a paralegal in public and private law offices, corporate law departments, and government agencies. Students learn how to communicate effectively with both lawyers and laymen. When acting under an attorney’s supervision, a trained paralegal can perform many law-related tasks although they do not give legal advice to clients, set fees or represent clients in court. Paralegals may not provide legal services directly to the public except as permitted by law.
Admission to the Legal Studies major is limited and based on space availability and the competitiveness of the applicant pool. Factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: courses completed, cumulative GPA, hours completed, personal interview or written statement, and samples of work completed. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission, and the application process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
 In order to gain admission into the Legal Studies minor, a student must have completed at least two (2) Legal Studies courses (one of which must be LGS 201); and must have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 2.50 in those two Legal Studies courses. For further information contact the Department of Politics and Government.

Admissions Information
Illinois State University’s Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders completes criminal background checks for all candidates for the Master’s Program in Speech-Language Pathology and the Doctoral Program in Audiology and reserves the right to deny admission based on application materials, previous academic records, and records of past conduct, including but not limited to the results of a criminal background check or registration of a sex offense.
Any offers of admission are contingent upon completing and passing a national background check. The department may refuse or revoke admission for the following: misrepresentation of self, criminal behavior, results of the national background check, and/or behavior that interferes with performing professional duties.
If admitted to a CSD graduate program, any applicant or student with a criminal background may not be eligible for some clinical placements. In addition, the applicant or student may not be eligible for licensure after completing the requirements for the advanced degree. Many clinical sites require criminal background checks for accepting a student clinician in their setting. It is the student’s responsibility to inquire with the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation or other professional licensure boards to determine their licensure eligibility.
Once admitted to a graduate program in CSD, students must report any new information or criminal convictions and adhere to the Professional Standards of the University and the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders. Students must meet the professional and ethical standards set forth by the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders.
In addition to the requirements of the Graduate School, the degree students must meet all the academic requirements and clinical practicum requirements for the Certificate of Clinical Competence of the American Speech-LanguageHearing Association. Copies of requirements for both Illinois and national certification 
can be found online. The graduate programs are accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation.
Students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.00 in major courses and overall to retain their degree status and to be eligible for department clinicals. Enrollment by graduate students in the department's clinicals requires degree status. In all instances, permission of the Clinic Director is needed for practicum enrollment, and enrollments may be restricted. External graduate clinicals may require special coursework and will require a student to provide transportation to external settings arranged by the department.
A candidate for the master's degree must 
complete two external placements
 in order to qualify for the degree. A degree student in the Doctor of Audiology program must spend one year in residency in order to qualify for the degree. A year in residence is interpreted as three consecutive semesters
 of enrollment in CSD 598.90 for one credit hour each semester.

Admission/Retention Requirements
All incoming undergraduate students are initially enrolled in the B.A. or B.S. programs, depending on their interests. Those who wish to apply to the B.F.A. program do so no earlier than the first semester during their sophomore year. 
The School of Art expects regular class attendance and supports faculty members who choose to reduce course grades for lack of participation, including excessive absences.
Students seeking admission to the Major in Art must comply with criteria established by the School of Art, including submission of a portfolio of work for review by the School. Students interested in the Art History Sequence will submit a statement explaining their interest in the field, in lieu of the portfolio. Specific requirements for the portfolio and statement may be obtained from the School office.
To graduate with a Major in Art (B.A., B.S.) students must complete all requirements of one of the School of Art’s Sequences: Studio Arts, Graphic Design, Art History, or Teacher Education. They must also earn grades of C or better and maintain a 2.50 GPA in all courses taken in the School of Art, in addition to maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00. Individual sequences may have higher requirements. Courses in the Major may be repeated no more than once for the purpose of attaining the necessary minimum grade. Students may not enroll for the next course in a related series until the minimum grade in the prerequisite course is achieved. Incoming transfer students must retake courses considered equivalents to courses in the Major for which they earned lower than a grade of C. Students who do not meet these criteria will be placed on probation with the School of Art; a student placed on probation more than once will be dropped from the School.
Admission to some Sequences in Art may be restricted by the lack of available School resources, especially in times of oversubscription. 
In times of oversubscription and limitations on resources within the School of Art, some Discipline Areas may require faculty screening of students’ supportive materials before allowing individual students to enroll in the second course in that Discipline.
All Sequences in the Major in Art require successful completion of the Art History Core, the Foundations program appropriate to that sequence, a series of courses specific to the chosen sequence, and electives in Art. Students must complete all Sequence Foundations courses before being permitted to continue in one of the sequences in the Art major; gifted students may be allowed to take 200-level courses in their areas of interest during the freshman year, pending approval of the School. Students must also complete all Art History Core courses before they may enroll in 300-level Art History courses.
Students must make every effort to complete the required Foundations courses in their first three semesters in the program. Under most circumstances students will formally declare intention to enter a particular sequence in the Art major by the second semester of the sophomore year. Students will arrange to participate in screening requirements for their preferred sequence; those not accepted into competitive sequences may be reconsidered the following semester and should consult with appropriate faculty for advice before rescreening. Also in the sophomore year, students will begin enrolling in courses appropriate to their sequence of interest. In the case of the Studio Arts Sequence, this also requires declaring a specific Discipline Area in consultation with the School’s academic advisor.
Students can begin to take Graphic Design courses after they have completed the Art History core and Studio Art Foundation courses. There is no portfolio review for admission but students must have and maintain a major and cumulative 2.50 GPA. Students whose cumulative or major GPA falls below 2.50 will not be allowed to register for Graphic Design courses until the GPA has been raised to a 2.50 or higher. Consult the School of Art for further information on admission and retention in the Graphic Design sequence.
Students will be admitted to the Art History Sequence with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50 and grades of B or better in ART 155 and ART 156. See the School of Art office for more information. Students will be allowed to continue in the sequence if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 2.50.
All Art majors planning to become licensed teachers must apply for and be admitted to the University Teacher Education program. Grades of C or better in all Art and Education courses, and a 2.50 cumulative and major GPA are required by the Art Teacher Education Area for admission and retention in the Art Teacher Education sequence. Continuation in the Art Teacher Education Sequence is not automatic. Students’ performance will be evaluated each semester.
The sequence in Teacher Education may also be combined with a sequence in Studio Arts, Graphic Design, or Art History. Pursuing a double sequence may require additional semesters. However, this option is strongly recommended to prepare students for teaching art. Students are also encouraged to take coursework in Urban Education and Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. 
Students may apply to the B.F.A. Degree program beginning in their sophomore year. Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the School of Art for the competitive review that is part of the admission process. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor. Students will be allowed to remain in the program if they maintain a minimum cumulative and major GPA of 3.00.To graduate with a B.F.A., all Studio Arts sequence students are also required to organize and present a solo exhibition of their work during the final year. This exhibition must be accompanied by a public oral presentation, an exit portfolio and a written supportive statement approved by the student's B.F.A. faculty mentors.
Students seeking admission to the B.F.A. program with a Sequence in Graphic Design must have a minimum 3.00 cumulative and major GPA and must submit a portfolio of creative work to the Graphic Design faculty for a competitive review. If a student drops below a 3.00 GPA or fails a required design course, the student will no longer be able to continue in the BFA sequence, but will be able to shift their design studies to the B.A./B.S. degree offering. Further information on admission requirements for the B.F.A. program is available from the School's undergraduate academic advisor.To graduate with a B.F.A., all Graphic Design sequence students are also required to participate in and help organize a group exhibition with the other B.F.A. Graphic Design students.

Major in Art (B.A., B.S.)
Students in the Art major must complete one of the following sequences.
Studio Arts Sequence
The Studio Arts Sequence emphasizes both breadth and depth of competence in Studio-based Art disciplines. It expands students’ horizons beyond the Foundations level with work in a variety of media and disciplines. By requiring intensive study, it develops depth within at least one Studio Discipline Area (ceramics, drawing, glass, intaglio, lithography, metal­work and jewelry design, painting, photography, sculpture, video, wood/metal or expanded media) through the completion of a specific series of courses. It likewise encourages exploration of new genres that break through traditional boundaries between disciplines and media.

Art History Sequence
The Art History Sequence provides students a solid grounding in the history of art on both introductory and advanced levels. In addition, the sequence includes exposure to related disciplines outside the visual arts, training in foreign language, and experience in advanced research and writing skills.

In special circumstances, students may satisfy the Art History language requirement with a language or languages other than “French, German, Italian or Spanish.” In such cases, the language(s) must be appropriate to the student’s plan of study and career goals. Alternate plans of language study must be approved by the Art History faculty in order to receive credit toward the sequence.
It is recommended that students select electives in courses related to Art History offered by the following departments/schools: Anthropology; English; Languages, Literatures, and Cultures; History; Music; Philosophy; Theatre and Dance. Students are encouraged to consult with the Art History faculty for advice on choosing electives in Art History and other departments that will complement their own areas of interests. Faculty are also available for consultation on preparing for graduate school.
Students may combine Art History and Studio by declaring a second Sequence in Studio Arts and fulfilling all requirements for both sequences. This will include submitting a portfolio of art work for admission.

Concurrent Admissions Program

This program allows Future Soldiers enlisting in the Army or Army Reserve to declare their intent to enroll at a college or university at the time of their enlistment. ConAP’s intent is for Soldiers to transition directly from the Army or Army Reserves to their ConAP-selected college and puts Soldiers on track to utilize Army education benefits.

Admission is deferred until completion of active duty service (after Basic and Advanced Individual Training for the Army Reserve). Please note, individuals must meet admission requirements in effect at the time of their enrollment and provide a Member 4 copy of their DD Form 214 (honorable discharge is required). Illinois State has a dedicated Veteran Admissions Liaison who serves at the University’s ConAP point of contact.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

This interdisciplinary minor prepares students to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in their communities. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world. The minor gives students opportunities to sharpen their analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action. The minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden their learning experience and career perspectives.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

 Minor in Ethnic Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies.

Approval for Teaching English as a Second Language
Students of both graduate and undergraduate standing may obtain an Illinois State Ap­proval for Teaching English as a Second Language by fulfilling the following require­ments: (1) fulfill Teacher Education require­ments of either the Standard Elementary and/or High School License, (2) complete the 18 hours of required coursework as listed in the minor in TESOL above, and (3) obtain 100 clock hours of ESL Clinical Experience or three months of teaching experience in Eng­lish as a Second Language at the appropriate level. This practical experience may be ob­tained by enrolling in ENG 394.
Major in English
The English Studies major is based on a broad model of interdisciplinary study in the fields that make up English Studies. The Department of English offers a full curriculum of courses in eight disciplines, including literature and cultural studies, children's literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition, technical communications, creative writing, the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and Publishing. Students learn how to write well, read critically, develop investigative research skills, working hands-on in digital environments and social networking, and frequently win some of the most prestigious awards at Illinois State, such as the Bone Scholarship. Faculty are eager to work with undergraduate students on research projects, and our low student-to-faculty ratio means you will receive guidance from professors who hold the highest doctoral degrees and are internationally recognized as experts in their fields. This flexibility in the degree allows both the student with interests in a variety of different fields in English Studies and the student who wants to specialize in a particular discipline to meet their goals.
For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit the Majors website or contact the undergraduate advisor for the intended major.
View English Course Requirements
Students can also satisfy the requirements for the English major by completing one of the following sequences.
Creative Writing Sequence
The Creative Writing sequence has a distinguished national reputation and is known for encouraging experimental writing. Courses develop talents in writing workshops that focus on fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or a combination. Small class sizes mean having ample opportunity to get feedback on writing from professors and peers. Outside the classroom, students have the chance to network with renowned visiting writers and present creative work at student readings. Students can also help produce and submit work to Euphemism, a journal for the creative arts.
View Creative Writing Sequence Course Requirements
Publishing Studies Sequence
The Publishing Studies sequence is designed to prepare graduates for careers in all types of publishing. Undergraduate students interested in nonprofit presses, journals, and scholarly publications are well suited for this sequence.  Skill sets acquired by completing the sequence include proofreading, editing, design and layout, marketing, advertising, permissions, graphic work, record keeping, archiving, and bulk/distribution mailing.

Notes
This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in History. In addition to the HIS 497 required course, students may choose to take up to 9 hours of graduate level electives to count towards the 9 credit hours of additional senior college level History electives required for the undergraduate program. It is strongly recommended that one of these courses be HIS 496, another required course for the MA/MS degree. Refer to the Course Finder website for 400-level graduate courses and 300-level courses that are approved for graduate credit. The student must consult with an advisor and the instructor prior to the start of each new course to ensure graduate-level approval. For information on graduate-level history requirements, please visit the graduate academic catalog.

Master of Fine Arts
Master of Fine Arts
Degrees Offered
Offered in the Wonsook Kim School of Art and the School of Theatre and Dance, the Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a terminal degree that emphasizes theory and practice in a particular discipline of the arts. 
Curriculum Requirements
Approved 11/19/87
A professionally oriented program, the M.F.A. requires a minimum of 60 semester hours for a student with only a bachelor's degree or a minimum of 32 hours for a student with an earned master's degree. The total hours required for a student with an earned master's degree will be based on an evaluation of the student's portfolio and academic record. However, the final determination will not be made until the student has completed a minimum of six semester hours in the student's major area of emphasis. A candidate for the degree must demonstrate proficiency both as a practitioner and a teacher in one of several areas of emphasis listed in the Graduate Catalog.
Time Limitations
Approved 11/19/87, Updated 3/22/01
All requirements for the Master of Fine Arts degree must be completed within eight calendar years, beginning with the date the student first registers as a degree student. This time limit applies to enrollment in all graduate coursework in the student’s program, including work for which transfer credit is allowed. If a course taken to complete the requirements for the M.F.A. degree is not taken within the eight year period allowed for the degree program, the student’s school may require the student to retake the course for credit or allow the student to demonstrate current knowledge of the subject matter. If the latter is used, currency must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the school offering the course through successful completion of an appropriate examination or other assessment if available from the school. Otherwise, outdated coursework must be deleted from, and other coursework must be substituted in, the degree audit. Credits more than eight years old at the time of first registration into a degree program are not transferable from other institutions. When graduate study is interrupted by military service or other contingencies, the eight-year limit may be extended by the Graduate School. Use the Request to Extend Time to Complete Masters/Doctoral Degree Program form at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms. 
Transfer Credit
Approved 11/19/87, Updated 3/22/01
Credits more than eight years old at the time of first registration into a Master of Fine Arts degree program are not transferable from other institutions. The work must not form part of a completed degree program elsewhere. Under special circumstances, the Graduate School may allow a student to present a larger number of credits if recommended by the school. A student who plans to take work elsewhere should obtain prior approval indicating that the course or courses are appropriate to the student’s curriculum at Illinois State University.
To be considered for transfer of credit, a course must meet the criteria outlined on the Transfer of Credit form and obtain approval from the Graduate School. The Transfer of Credit form is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms.
In the Wonsook Kim School of Art, a student can transfer no more than nine semester hours of credit from any graduate program (including a master's program in Art at Illinois State University) for use in meeting the requirements of the M.F.A. degree. In the School of Theatre and Dance, a student who does not have an earned master's degree may present a maximum of six semester hours of credit from another college or university for use in meeting the requirements of the M.F.A. degree. However, the student may present all earned hours from a master's program in Theatre at Illinois State for use in meeting these requirements. A Theatre student who has an earned master's degree must earn a minimum of 32 hours in the M.F.A. program at Illinois State University.
Residency Requirement
Approved 11/19/87
A student without an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least four semesters with at least two of them being full-time, consecutive semesters. A student with an earned master's degree must complete a residency requirement of at least two full-time, consecutive semesters. Summer session may be counted toward the two consecutive semester requirement only in the School of Theatre and Dance.
Admission to Candidacy
Approved 11/19/87
In order to be admitted to candidacy, the student without an earned master's degree must have completed 24 hours of graduate study at Illinois State University or two semesters of full-time resident study.
The student with an earned master's degree must have completed 12 hours of graduate study at Illinois State University or one semester of full-time resident study. All students must have a grade average of B or better with no more than 5 (6 in Theatre) hours below a grade of B.
Before becoming a candidate for the M.F.A. in Art the student must pass a candidacy review that includes approval of the following items: portfolio of studio work, final Degree Audit, and proposal for the Supportive Statement (an exhibition-related written project).
Before becoming a candidate for the M.F.A. in Theatre the student must have a Degree Audit on file with the Graduate School and pass a qualifying examination which is administered by the student's M.F.A. portfolio committee. Admission to candidacy, which usually occurs in the final semester, must be satisfied before the student is allowed to schedule an exit portfolio presentation. The Degree Audit form is available at Grad.IllinoisState.edu/students/forms. 
Academic Advisors
Approved 11/19/87
In the Wonsook Kim School of Art, the student in the pre-candidacy phase of the program selects a major advisor with the help of the Graduate Coordinator/Director. With the help of the major advisor the student selects a candidacy review committee of three members. The chairperson of this committee must be from the student's major area of emphasis. Normally, the candidacy review committee continues as the student's graduate committee during the candidacy phase of the program.
In the School of Theatre and Dance the director, in consultation with faculty whom the director deems appropriate, will select the candidate's Portfolio Committee. The committee chairperson must come from the student's major area of emphasis.

ISU General Education Program
Illinois State University's General Education Program
The General Education Program at Illinois State University is an integrated multi-disciplinary set of courses that focuses on the development of communication and problem-solving skills and abilities, such as persuasion, listening, and argumentation; logical and quantitative thinking; and understanding varying perspectives on issues. These skills and abilities provide an essential grounding for work in the student’s major as well as transferable skills that will be applied in a future career.
The complete General Education Program consists of 13 courses (39 semester hours), which is approximately one-third of the total credits required for graduation.
Because of laboratory or recitation requirements, some courses are listed as four or five credit hours in this catalog. All four or five hours will be credited toward graduation requirements, but only three hours will be credited in General Education for these courses.
Students will take most General Education courses during their freshman and sophomore years, along with some courses in their major or other elective courses. While some specific courses are important to take as part of preparation for a major (such as certain mathematics or science courses), the choice of which course to take in each category is a decision for students to make. Students are encouraged to choose courses that will give them the broadest possible foundation and to explore and challenge themselves through their course choices.
Codes used throughout the Illinois State University General Education Program include the following:
FA - Fine Arts
H - Humanities
ICL - Individuals and Civic Life
LH - Language in the Humanities
M - Mathematics
NS - Natural Science
NSA - Natural Science Alternatives
QR - Quantitative Reasoning
SMT - Science, Mathematics, and  Technology
SS - Social Sciences
UST - United States Traditions
Students must comply with the following requirements:
Complete the General Education Program through completion of at least 13 courses (39 semester hours), as designated in the program description.
No Group 1 course may be taken under the P/NP option. If a General Education course is required by a major, that course may not be taken P/NP it must be taken for a grade.
Students must complete at least one course from two different sciences. Certain majors require a Natural Science Alternative course that substitutes for a Natural Science course. See individual major requirements.
Depending on their major students may be exempted from one General Education category (maximum of one course) because of disciplinary expertise gained in their major listed in the table to the right.

A chemistry or math course in the major may not be attempted more than twice during a student’s undergraduate career. An exception may be requested only once for only one course during a student's undergraduate career if the GPA in the major plan is 2.00 or higher, and the overall GPA is 2.00 or higher. A student who does not complete the course with a grade of C or better on the third attempt will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Any student who would need an additional third enrollment to enroll in any other required chemistry or math course in the major will at that time become ineligible to continue in the major. Each attempt in which the student receives a grade, including a grade of WX, is counted as an attempt.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Admission/Retention Requirements
Interdisciplinary Studies majors and minors bring together multiple subject areas under a single theme. Students can create their own major or minor, or select an established interdisciplinary minor in addition to their traditional major. Students may not apply directly to the interdisciplinary major sequences. Admission to these sequences may be requested after the completion of 15 semester hours of coursework. Students should work with their academic advisor to apply for minors.

Interdisciplinary Studies Major
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Under the Major in Interdisciplinary Studies, a student may construct one of three individualized programs of study that differ from the University’s regular major programs. These options use existing University courses and lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Each sequence addresses a different set of educational objectives.
Human and Educational Services Sequence
This sequence recognizes work that students have completed in working towards a teacher education degree. Completion of this degree program does not allow for recommendation for teacher licensure. Students in this program will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Human and Educational Services Sequence.”
View Human and Educational Services Sequence Requirements
Individualized Sequence 
This sequence allows a student to design, with the help of a faculty sponsor, a specialized program of study that is not offered by the University. This program is intended for the student whose specific interests do not fall within existing programs. Some topics recently chosen by students include East Asian Studies, Classical Civilization, Three-Dimensional Design, International Public Administration, and Theatre Management. The Individualized Sequence is often a second or auxiliary major but may be proposed as a primary major. Students who complete the Individualized Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and have their transcripts noted: “Plan: Interdisciplinary Studies; Sub-plan: Individualized Sequence; Theme: __” (the theme specified on the plan of study).
View Individualized Sequence Requirements
Liberal Studies Sequence
Liberal Studies provides opportunities for students to build a concentration of coursework to create a major of interest. It is intended for the student who is seeking a baccalaureate degree without the specialization of a traditional major. The student chooses the focus of the program by determining the departments or schools in which they wish to pursue advanced work and will work with an advisor to develop a plan of study to meet all degree requirements. Students who complete the Liberal Studies Sequence will earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree and their transcript will be noted “Interdisciplinary Studies; Liberal Studies Sequence.”

This interdisciplinary minor prepares students to enact social change and to develop an awareness of personal social responsibility that includes active engagement in their communities. Students in the minor collaborate with community partners to create a more just and equitable world. The minor gives students opportunities to sharpen their analysis of social issues, practice public problem solving skills, reflect on civic engagement experiences with an appreciation for individual and community strengths, and enact a commitment to ethical civic action. The minor is open to students of any ideological viewpoint and can be matched with any major to broaden their learning experience and career perspectives.

Concentration for Teacher Education Majors Interested in Urban Education
The Minor in Civic Engagement and Responsibility also offers a special concentration for teacher education majors. You should consider this concentration if you have an interest in urban education and you want to collaborate with urban communities for advocacy and social justice.
The concentration includes courses that have a strong focus on diversity, anti-racism, and community-engaged classrooms. Many of these courses offer hands-on activities and assignments in urban schools and communities. The courses let you dig deeper and explore systemic issues of race, class, and privilege as you observe, interact, and apply your entire curriculum into your teacher identity and practice.
Teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation courses with designated sections can refer to UTP Passport (TeacherPipeline.IllinoisState.edu/National Center for Urban Education) for updated course information.
In consultation with their advisor, teacher education majors interested in urban teacher preparation are recommended to choose four courses (12 credit hours) from the following courses that have an urban education focus (only one course at the 100 level can be taken)

 Minor in Ethnic Studies
https://illinoisstate.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/ 
Ethnic Studies is the study of race and ethnicity in U.S. and transnational contexts. Students and faculty in this area examine how people conceptualize social categories like race, indigeneity, culture, ethnicity, and nation. We also familiarize ourselves with the specific and comparative experiences (both historical and contemporary) of the major population groups that make up the United States and the globe. The program at Illinois State allows participants to examine regional, national, and global dimensions of these experiences. 
Students interested in pursuing a major in this area may arrange their program of study through the Interdisciplinary Studies Major program in consultation with the Ethnic Studies advisor. 
Minors are also available in three specific areas: African-American Studies; Latin American and Latino/a Studies; and Native American Studies. A list of affiliated faculty and more information is available through the Ethnic Studies website. Other affiliated programs include: African Studies, East Asian Studies, and Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies.

Internationalize Your Major
How to Participate
If you study a world language in high school or you already speak a second language, an internationalized minor, study abroad program, and major are within your grasp.
Knowing more than one language and having experience in another culture are more important than ever. Employers in the United States and internationally are looking for people who can help them reach diverse clients and partners around the world.
By combining your study of world languages with your major, you will acquire the skills to navigate today's work environment and make yourself more marketable.
Are you ready to prepare for your future? Contact your University College advisor or the Major advisor listed below to learn how to internationalize your major.

Undocumented Students
Overview
Diversity is a core value at Illinois State University, and we welcome all applicants regardless of citizenship status. Undocumented students, with or without Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), who apply to Illinois State are treated identically to any U.S. citizen or permanent resident.

How to Apply
Undocumented students should follow the same application procedure as everyone else.
When answering the citizenship question, undocumented students should select "undocumented."
We do not require a Social Security number or proof of residency to apply. Undocumented students should leave the Social Security question blank.
Start Application
Paying for College
Illinois State University is committed to supporting undocumented students in their dream of attaining a college degree. While undocumented and DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) students do not qualify for state or federal aid through the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) due to their status, there are other resources that can be pursued to help with educational costs.
If at any time your status changes, please let the Financial Aid Office know.
To qualify for federal financial aid, a student must be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen. A DACA student can have a Social Security number, but that alone does not qualify you for the FAFSA. If you are unsure of whether or not you can file a FAFSA, you can check eligibility requirements.
You do not have to file a FAFSA to be eligible for scholarships; however, state and federal laws prohibit Illinois State from awarding need-based state or federal aid to undocumented students.
RISE Act
The Retention of Illinois Students & Equity (RISE) Act allows eligible undocumented students and transgender students who are disqualified from federal financial aid to apply for all forms of state financial aid. The Alternative Application for Illinois Financial Aid provides a pathway for these qualified students to apply for Monetary Award Program (MAP) grants, the state's largest need-based grant program for low-income college students.
Learn more about the Alternative Application
Merit-Based Scholarships
The review process is the same for all students regardless of citizenship status.
Admissions Scholarships
Departmental Scholarships
Undocumented students are eligible for Illinois State departmental scholarships if they meet the scholarship's minimum requirements. Requirements will vary, and most do not require citizenship.

Loans
You are eligible to take out an alternative loan through any bank/lender of your choice. You will be required to have a U.S. citizen as your co-signer.

Endorsement areas may impact General Education requirements. Consult your advisor. 
Middle Level Education majors must choose two content areas for endorsement. Passage of ILTS content exams may be requried beyond the coursework listed. Since ISBE subsequent endorsement requirements are subject to change due to updated licensure code, students must confirm current requirements with their academic advisor each year of enrollment to ensure required coursework and additional ISBE licensure requirements for each endorsement are completed at the time of graduation.

Facility and Space Use
How to Reserve a University Facility or Space
How to Reserve a University Facility or Space
Contact the scheduling coordinator for the facility or space you want to use to check on its availability.
Complete the required forms to reserve the facility or space.
When reserving facilities for events or activities, the event planner will consider (a) whether the requested location is suitable for the event or activity, and (b) whether health and safety concerns require special precautions or arrangements (e.g., security staff; Emergency Medical Service personnel; other security; insurance requirements; and related loss prevention measures).
Reservations for facilities and spaces are generally decided on a first-come, first-served basis. Occasions may arise when an official University activity takes precedence for use of an already scheduled space. In the event rescheduling is necessary, the event planner will work with the individual or organization sponsoring the displaced activity to find suitable alternative locations and times that are reasonable under the circumstances.
Every event is unique, bringing with it specific risks and requirements. Events may be evaluated for the likelihood and consequences of potential risks.
The department or unit that reserves and oversees the facility or space will provide an agreement to the party requesting the reservation that defines the date, time and location for the event or activity and expectations for security, insurance, and safety regarding the event along with any additional special requirements.
The reservation is complete when the agreement is signed by both parties and all expectations and requirements are met.
